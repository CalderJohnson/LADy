What's the difference between train_V2 and the train files in semeval folders?
We can consider ,aspect, category as ,latent, since no where they occurr?!

Next:
- skip: word alignment
- skip: semantic context
- skip: train: skip models ctm, nrl, brt
- skip: test: I need to talk to Farinam for ctm and nrl

- training+test w/ augmentation
    - where to put the aos of back-translated version (we can assume same aos as the parent)

- *visualization

Training sets:
- Laptop

Distribution of words in sem_evals

baselines on
- a review as concat of all sentences

add category to review objects
split: stratified on category, but how about aspect term? we cannot do since term could be anything!
