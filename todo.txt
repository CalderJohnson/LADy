What's the difference between train_V2 and the train files in semeval folders?
We can consider ,aspect, category as ,latent, since no where they occurr?!

Next:
- skip: word alignment
- skip: prep on the back-translated versions
- train+test: octis only!!
- refactor quality metrics as octis offers many
- find a nice way to switch between lady and octis

- training+test w/ augmentation
    - where to put the aos of back-translated version (we can assume same aos as the parent) for the unsupervised
	- but for supervised

- visualization

add category to review objects
split: stratified on category, but how about aspect term? we cannot do since term could be anything!
