"If the weather is nice, try to get a table outside."
"The staff was nice, but she seemed very stressed and the unisex bathtub needs to be cleaned more often."
"From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waiter, I felt like a king and enjoyed every second."
"Since we were the last guests and it was after closing time, the waitress did not rush us and made us feel comfortable and relaxed."
I recommend Russian caviar to anyone who wants delicious caviar and fantastic service .
Nice family business .
Fresh ingredients and everything on order.
A friendly staff who will let you enjoy the food and the company.
"I thought the food was excellent, especially the laughter device I had."
"I also ordered the Mojito change, which was from this world."
"My friends made up their minds about the rice dishes, but the next day we came back to try the Dim Sum, which was good... not excellent, but good."
"We ate outside in the backyard, which is worth it, because it's cool and the music is good."
This is an excellent restaurant.
The food was good.
It was nice and quiet.
But the service was a little slow.
The buffet had a nice selection.
"The food was average or higher , including some surprising flavors ."
"The service was very good, too."
I have an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had some other nice pastries .
"I'd recommend Roxy for that, but not for her food."
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!
"As a result, their burger fell apart in their hands and caused so much chaos that they didn't feel like ending it."
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .
"This place is really trendy, but they forgot the most important part of a restaurant, the food."
"The last two times I ordered here, my food was so spicy, I could barely eat it, and the spice took away the flavor of the dish."
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
"If you want good authentic Thai, this is not the place."
"We were here for lunch a few weeks ago, and I was very impressed with the food."

We had the shells as a starter and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
We waited in the bar and we had the right martinis.
I love the food .
It 's the only place you can get good authentic Japanese comfort .
I've been living in New York for five years and here's everything.

A Thai restaurant without rice during dinner?
"The food came 20 minutes after I called, cold and wet."

Excellent service .
"We were greeted by the waiter, who was very kind and warm."
"She was very helpful in offering us drinks and helped us order many good dishes, since we knew nothing about Indian food."

"The service was great, the food was fantastic."

"Always a nice crowd, but never loud."
I'm hesitant to write because I don't want my pizza place to get crowded.
- The best pizza in Manhattan.
"The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly."
The menu has so many fish items and oysters.
The fish was really fresh.
We all agreed that Mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York.
I ran into a big pizzeria while exploring my new neighborhood.
All the pizza is great and the price is even better!
I recommend Sophia 's pizza .
"The food was moderate at best, but it was the terrible service that made me never return."

"For people who want good food and good services, Roxy is a place to avoid!"
"The first time the sushi was excellent, the second time it was a little weak."
"The blonde wooden decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great."
Mizu is the Japanese discovery in grammar.
"While their cuisine is delicious, their sushi is not of this world."
Mizu is home to creative and unique roles that you can't find anywhere else.
"Not only is the kitchen the best, but the service was always attentive and charming."
Warning: You may find it difficult to eat in other Japanese restaurants after you 've been to Mizu !
"Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite fit."
I ordered the smoky salmon and the roe game and it wasn't tasty.
"The entrance was small and weak, the dessert was uninspired."
I expected a lot more from such an expensive menu .
The view is spectacular and the food is great.
And wonderful strawberry dairy!

The cold pre-taste dishes taste like I experienced them in Taiwan.

It 's a great neighborhood .
This is a nice pizza place with a good selection of thin crustal pizza including the basil .
"Your calzones are terrible, bad, causing vomiting, junk."
Customer service is bad.
No pizza 33 for me!
"The cans are narrow, unattractive and greasy, and I personally would drink popcorn topping before I eat another one of them."
"The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and far too expensive."
"Hampton Chutney warns that these people offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive space with helpless employees, there was also a lack of first class."
This is a real asshole.
"The atmosphere is unheard of, the service is unheard of, and the food is great."
The best Italian food I've ever eaten (and being Italian means a lot).

The service is terrible.
This place is not worth it.
I love pizza 33 .
I'm out with friends and suddenly I'm hungry and I just want one thing... their pizza.
This little place in Williamsburg is always pleasantly surprising.
The pizza is delicious and the owner is one of the finest in New York.
The cream cheese is from this world and I love this coffee !
"Bagels are fine, but don't make any special requests."
I asked for an open-cheese sandwich and the manager told me to do my business elsewhere!
Make sure you don't get anything but bagels!
The turkey burgers are terrible!
The soup for the Udon was soy sauce and water.
The sushi was terrible!
The rice was of poor quality and so poorly cooked that it was heavy.
"Besides, the rice didn't have any spices, so the sushi was dirty and disgusting."
"The fish was cut enough, but unknowingly."
It 's obvious that no one at the restaurant has any idea or experience of Japanese cuisine .
- Good service and quick.
Food is good and cheap.
This place is perfect.
"Well, it's such a ghetto, it's not even funny."
"If you like to mess up your music and the system isn't that good and you want to pay at least $100 for a bottle minimum, then you're gonna love it here."
"It 's a great pizza , especially the Margherita slices ."
It's a great feeling and worth it.

It's definitely a good place for snacks and conversations.

"The waiting area is pleasant, fun and usually beautiful (in the wonderful aesthetic display, not in the way it is more beautiful than I am)."
"The food is delicious, especially its boiled shells in spicy tomato sauce and its crispy, crispy potatoes."
But the best thing about LS is the nighttime atmosphere that BTS enjoys.
"You can have a perfectly delicious Martini in a glass (that 's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $ 8.50 (I recommend the vanilla shade , mmmm!) in a great home environment with great music ."
The DJ on Saturday night has a great musical flavor and also accepts requests.
You can 't go wrong .
Suan is a great place to take my friends.
The location is good and the fact that Hutner College is nearby and the prices are very reasonable makes the students return to Suan again and again.
I love her Thai.
Shark noodles and chicken and coconut juice are a must!
I'll be back in Suan soon!
"In the summer, eat out on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!"
I can't imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.
I can't think of a better Indian food in the whole city.
"In the last three months, the boss and the staff have changed, and it hasn't been for the better."
The food is not consistent right now.
This is the kind of place you take your friends and still want to keep a secret.
The environment is casual and romantic.
The food is delicious!
"If you dare, try the balsamic vinegar on ice cream, it's wonderful!"
"You don't have hamburgers, no matter what the critics say."

"A few tips: skip the beef cake , roast beef buns and egg buns ."
The food was exceptional.
"I picked one of the specialties, the roasted lamb shawl in red wine, which was excellent."
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was calm.

This little town has a sweet interior and affordable city prices.
"The Pad Se Ew chicken was delicious, but the Pad Thai was way too fat."
"I've eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good."
The roasted dumplings are great!
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant !

"It's also great to eat in a very romantic and comfortable place, the service is just perfect... they're so friendly we never want to live there!"

"Small portions for the main entrance meal, I had salmon (wasn't impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good."
The dessert is a joke.
"When we call virgins or weekly friends, they're all treated the same and you can't ask for more if the service is so friendly."
The Commission has the possibility to support the Commission and it has the possibility to support the Commission to support the Commission.
"Anti-pasta was excellent , especially the Kalamari , like the filling pasta main ."

"If you dare to go outside the island of Manhattan and you don't find a great Italian restaurant, you're going to Corona."

A cozy romantic atmosphere with a maximum of 15 tables.
"The service was very fast, but slightly hasty."
"The food was very good, but not as I would see it from this world."
It's a shame the food wasn't from the same source.
"The porcini pasta soup special was tasteless, as was the seafood tagniatelle."
But that wasn't the ice cream on the cake. It was a tiramisu that never looked like me.
I really liked this place .
Here are the best Chinese-style cracks.
I also recommend rice dishes or the various types of congee.
It's definitely not a place to go if you want to impress someone.

Quick and friendly .

We were sitting outside and the waiter was spitting red wine and hot tea on me and my date.
