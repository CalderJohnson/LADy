"Try the pad thai, it's fabulous and its prices are so cheap!","[[2, 3]]"

The service is good and the atmosphere is good for a date or a group excursion.,"[[1], [6]]"
The only drawback in this restaurant is the prices.,[[5]]
"Although they're good seafood, the prices are too high.",[[3]]
"The lobster sandwich is $24 and while it was good, it was hardly enough to justify that price.","[[1, 2]]"
"The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak) and the service was first class.","[[1], [7, 8], [12], [15]]"
"When my dessert came in, there was a candle on it -- not because someone asked me to -- but because the waiter saw me open my birthday card and gift card, and said he knew it was a special occasion of some kind.",[[22]]
It 's the mark of a careful waiter .,[[7]]
I recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.,[[3]]

"After dinner, the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him where you're from, maybe you don't know how things work in America, and he walked away almost crying, yelling that tips are the only thing that survives.",[[3]]

"The anti-paste was excellent, especially the squid, as well as the filling pastes.","[[1], [6], [12, 12]]"
The list of wines is extensive and you can easily go through a meal of another reasonable price .,"[[3, 1], [13]]"

But it wasn't the cake enamel: a tiramisu that didn't look like anything he'd ever had.,[[7]]
I really liked this place .,[[4]]
This place has the best Chinese-style ribs in town.,"[[6, 6]]"
