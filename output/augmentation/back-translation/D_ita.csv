Limited menu not so fresh fish ingredients cut into small slices of rice
"The only things you can enjoy are highly salted soy sauce (even low in sodium), vinegar-wet rice, and fish-on-fish pickle."

"The service was terrible, we had to wait and ask the same thing from several people before we were allowed to be served."

"After dinner, the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him, ""Where are you from... maybe you don't know how things work in America... and he finally walked away with tears almost screaming that tips are the only thing that allows them to survive."

Warning: You may find it difficult to dine in other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu
"Thalia's a nice restaurant with beautiful people who need you, but the food doesn't fit."
I ordered smoked salmon and Roe's appetite and it was out of taste.

Cremated cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee !
"The bagels are good, but make sure you don't make any special requests!"
I asked for a face-up cheese sandwich and the manager told me to take my work elsewhere!
All you have to do is bagel .
Turkey burgers are scary!
Worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.

"The Saturday night house dj lady has an extraordinarily good taste in music, and she also accepts requests."
You can't go wrong with this place.
Suan is a great place to take my friends too.
"Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is nearby and their prices are very reasonable, makes students come back to Suan again and again."
I love their Thai.
Noodle with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must!
I'll be back in Suan soon!
Summer-dining out on a terrace (another great feature of suan)!!!
I can't imagine a more friendly staff working in a restaurant.
I can't imagine any better Indian food in the whole city.

The food was absolutely fantastic!!
The coated mashed octopuses we shared as appetites were the best we ever had!!
"The lamb was so tender and full of flavor, the sweet was divine!!"

Sweet is a joke. Don't worry.
"Whether it's virgins or regular customers, everyone is treated the same and you can't ask for more when the service is so friendly."
The restaurant has a not least familiar feeling about the huge portions of p; the calf alone could have solved the Third World famine alone.
"The anti-pasta was excellent, especially squid like the filling paste tiles."
The list of wines is extensive and can be easily reached with a meal otherwise at reasonable prices

The shrimp were excellent and the snacks were abundant.
"If you venture out of Manhattan Island and can't find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona."

A romantic conscience with only 15 tables at most.
The service was very fast but a little rushed.
"The food was very good, but not what I would consider out of the world."
Too bad the food wasn't the same legacy.

I also recommend rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).
It's not a place to go if you want to impress someone.

The jukebox plays everything from Italian opera to hits.

In an area that unfortunately lacks decent Thai food this is one of the best places.

Beef noodle soup is good too.

Staff are very careful and on the ground.
Indian food and service are incredible.
The owner really meets all your needs.
Great food and very reasonable prices.
The food here does a great service to the name (in Cantonese which is...).

"This place that's only a few months old, is perhaps Queen's biggest secret!"
"Fantastic décor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very, very good food at a good price, generally personal friendly and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home... a lot of soho/village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and fancy clientele...all on Roosevelt Avenue!"
We were sitting outside and the waiter poured red wine and hot tea on me and my girlfriend.
"You'd think we'd get an excuse or free drinks -- instead, we have a snobby waiter who wouldn't even accept our order for 15 minutes and gave us a lip when we asked him to."
"With so many good restaurants at UW, I don't need too expensive, absurdly arrogant food, employees don't realize they work in a glorified restaurant, clumsy service, and management hat doesn't matter."
I'm relatively new to the area and I tried to get a Bgel in the second and I was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was too much and on the expensive side.
The food is good and the prices are mediocre.
Balushi's has solid food and nice furnishings at reasonable prices.

"Love the scene first, the place has a character and a beautiful light, very lucky, logically."
The pizza was pretty good and huge.
We were four years old and we took the family from a vodka pen that was a tremendously giant serving-- a literally bucket of food.
"The pen paste was pretty extra butter, creamy, which means a big job to dig... tasty at first, but I'd say I was full of a slice of pizza and seven to count, pennies..."

I love the atmosphere. I felt like Paris.
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert.. will definitely be back very soon.
I've been here for years and I have nothing better to say about the service and the great staff at The Lantern.
"Over the years, the host, Vitorio and his team have always treated me like a family. Although with all the work this little gem does, it's amazing that it's also able to remember a regular but not so frequent visitor."
"I've also been surprised by all the new additions in recent years: a new jazz bar, the most fantastic dining garden, the finest thin-crusted pizzas, and now a dying lasagna menu (not your average lasagna)!"
I love this place.
"I must say, I've never had a discouraging meal here."
We could have prepared a meal with the sweet donuts from the donut menu.

Delivery may be on time or not depending on the time and day of the week.
The delivery guy will get angry sometimes if you don't give you a tip above 10%.

I ordered the Vittello at the Marsala and I was very impressed.

The food is always fresh ...
Japanese food too expensive with mediocre service

Fish dynamite is also from another world.
I like sushi in New York.

The rolls are creative and I haven't found another sushi that serves more creative and delicious Japanese food yet.
"The dance, the white river and the rolls of the millennium are the must."
I can eat here every day of the week .
It's bad food.
I don't remember the last time I ate this crap in New York.
My quesadilla tasted like it was made by a three-year-old with no sense of proportion or taste.
And $11 for a plate of guacamole .
Don't even start with margaritas.

The furniture needs to be updated but the food is great!
This little place in Astoria Souvlaki makes what many consider the best gyroscopes in New York.
"What makes it really brilliant is the food that is aggressively seasoned with cirpriot spices, and all made at home (even the giraffe meat and sausages, and made of much higher quality ingredients than you might otherwise expect."
"All the different Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the turkey is the reason to come - if you don't eat one, your trip has been wasted."
The best restaurant in Brooklyn
"Great food, great service, this place is class action."
The beef was amazing last night.
This place is a must-visit!
Most cabins let you sit next to each other without looking like that couple.
"The food is shared, so we can order and eat together."
My daughter's wedding party by the waterfront received the highest praise from our guests.
Everyone was excited about the atmosphere (elegant rooms and absolutely unparalleled views and fabulous food).
The service was wonderful .
Paul the D's was totally professional and always on top of things.
Thank you all at the water's edge.
"- Service, but a dishonourable bath."
"The high prices you'll pay are for the view, not the food."
"The drinks at the bar were... okay, to say the least."
The tilapia stuff was horrible... with a cardboard taste.
"We thought the candy was better, wrong!"
"Oh, speaking of bathroom, men's bathroom was disgusting."
"The wine list was extensive, although the staff didn't seem to know the wine pairs."
"The bread we received was horrible - hard and cold - and the ""gratis"" appetite of olives was disappointing."
But our main course was wonderful.
"I had fish and my husband had filet, both exceeded our expectations."
"The dessert (we had a pear cake was good - but, again, the staff is unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions."
"When we asked for ports, the waitress listed several but didn't know what the tastes or costs were."
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this place.
"I mean, I would have come back, since it was a nice restaurant, but I hope the staff will pay more attention to the little details in the future."
- The places are great.
Both aren't as small as some reviews make them perfect for two people.
The service was extremely fast and careful thanks to the service button on your desk) but I just understood a word when the waiter took our order.
"The food was good and fair, nothing to go mad about."
- It 's a place that doesn 't look like it anymore .
"So what you end up paying for is the restaurant, not the food."
Food and fine services
Noodle pudding is exactly the kind of service and food I like.
"The servers are all different, Greg is my favorite."
"Sometimes the tables don't understand your sense of humor, but it's refreshing to have a server that has personality, professionalism and respect for dinner privacy."
This is the first place a runner remembers my order... I hope he likes his job because I have half the mind to steal it for my restaurant.
Prices are balanced for all food and beverages
"I go out to eat and I like my classes, the servers are patient and they never rush me to classes or force me to drink anything else."
Fantastic fresh dogs but the best of all are the infinite topping !!
"This place had all the decorations, and I mean everything."
This is great fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do me a favor and check this place out!!!!
Getting home last night was a unique experience in New York!
"Very impressed with the decor, the food, the hospitality, the great evening I had!"
"It's a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemonade and lime juice and mint leaves, so it's worth dying for!"
"The food took a while to prepare, and it's worth the wait."
We were drawn to the belly dance show that captured the crowd.
"I never write about these sites, but this restaurant is worth praising!"
T-shirt in food
"The menu was great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came in, it was average."
"Anyway, I finished the dish, and that's when I found a worm in the mushroom sauce at the bottom."
I showed it to the manager and he apologized smiling and brought us two free desserts (but he didn 't ask us what we wanted and so he brought the last two desserts we were going to ask for).
"The manager finally said that he would mix the two glasses of wine (which cost less than food), and made it seem like a big concession."
"I've worked in restaurants and cooked a lot, and there's no way a shirt can fit into a well-cooked meal."
"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so crowded, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service."
I 've had my hair in my food twice since !
A place of great value.
"The food is tasty, abundant and reasonably priced."
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.
It's a great place to order or sit.
The sushi experience with my boyfriend was amazing.
Good creative roles
"Yamato is an excellent place to go if you don't like sashimi, or if you have friends who don't like sushi very much."
"They have big reels, triple color, and Norwegian reels are fantastic and satisfying."
"A special roll and a regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save space for dessert."
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert and a big tempura green tea.
The appetites are delicious too!
Amazing food.
"Other, of iron or non-alloy steel"
Big food
I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this place offers.
"The atmosphere was pretty nice but it was missing a little, which he tries to compensate with a crazy pattern of mirrors."
"Despite the confusing mirrors, this will probably be my favorite modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future."
The Indo-Chinese food is pretty good...
A very elegant but not very good place Chinese style Indian food
"Chicken is my favorite, most dishes (I must agree with an earlier reviewer) are quite fatty and very spicy, especially onion chicken"
"My mother introduced me to this place, but she (being Indian) feels that food can be a little too spicy and too fat."
I was speechless about the horrible food .
"I went to a party dinner at the restaurant, and the food was very disappointing."
"Instead of making a vegetarian dish, the cook gave me a steamed vegetable dish (minor sauce, condiment or any shape or aesthetic presentation)."
This place only survives on reputation.
"This is the most wonderful restaurant in all of New York City, not just Brooklyn..."
"For seven years they've been putting out the tastiest, most delicious food and keeping it like this..."
"You never move, you never eat badly, you never serve badly."
"Great food , great wine , great neighborhood service ."
Patsy 's pizza is true love .
- The best pizza on the planet.
Big hot dogs .
Hot dogs were sweet and sweet on the inside and had a lot of crunch and snaps on the outside.
A place where you should go to eat late or take a midday jump!
"I think the dishes are a little fat, but the overall lunch experience is good."
Service and average price per plate is $10.
The only thing that 's affecting you is the furnishings .
Big food
This place has great Chinese Indian food.
"Get ready to wait, because the place is pretty small."
"Even though the place isn't nice, the food speaks for itself."
"The best Chinese Indian in town, by far!"
"I ran into the underground village by accident, now I always go there."
Martini's great and very affordable.
"The service is great, I've had several waiters, and they've all been nice, which is rare in New York."
The DJ's great. I've been there for my birthday and a lot of other times with my friends and I keep coming back.
Everything on the menu is great.
This establishment is real.
"I'd like more places like this: intimate, great food, first-class home, definitely worth the wait."
But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include wine?
"Look, the appetites were really good."
The entrance was also very good.
What you pay for is the environment and the name.
"Yeah, the place is stylish and nice, but they're definitely focusing on Uber Whealthy, not the average Joe who wants to get all messed up every now and then."
"Vanison was good, but not incredible."
Bison was pretty excellent.
The dessert is a disaster.
"I read reviews that said the restaurant was too expensive, and I thought, maybe it's worth it."
"Four seasons have a history, and it's kind of a New York City restaurant landmark, but believe me, they'll charge you through the nose just so you can say, ""I've been to a four-season restaurant""."
"All in all, the food was great (except for desserts."
The setting is very elegant and you'll see many rich guys with trophy wives or highly paid escorts.
"If you go for food, it's not worth it."
"You think they'll make it up to you with the service, unfortunately not."
"The service was just fine, not what you'd expect for $500."
I agree that eating at Casa la femme is not like any other culinary experience!
I just got home from visiting Casa la femme and I was so offended by my visit I felt the need to try to warn other customers who value their time and money.
"We're late for the reservation, so I can't complain too much about waiting for a table."
This place is beautiful!
The housewife was very nice.
"Anyway, our $14 drinks were awful!"
We also asked for the intersection six times and the waiter kept telling us a minute and never returned the intersection.
After the fourth time I asked again and the waiter said after dinner.
We asked for sides that the waiter admitted he forgot to include in our order.
"My chicken was sweltering, because there was so much fat in it that I had to keep spitting in my napkin."
I wouldn't expect that for a $55 dinner.
"When we left, our wallets were full and our stomachs were full, and we missed the show we were supposed to see after dinner, which would have been acceptable if we had been able to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!"
"If it seemed possible to do so while I was there I would have fought my bill, since my dinner portion of my meal was undesirable!"
"I've never left a restaurant feeling abused, and I've wasted my hard-earned money."
The menu is pretty simple without much description.
"There was no tap beer that night, which was a disappointment."
"It wasn't a big selection of bottled beer, we took Brahma."
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and musk were delicious but a small serving (maybe 3 of each).
"The lobster cuffs were good, but rather tasteless."
I think there were two shrimps in the appetizer.
"I ate the Thai-style fried marmot, which was very good."
"Everyone seemed satisfied with the food, except for my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi, apparently soaked in grape juice!"
I heard the lobster roll was excellent.
"All the food was good, a little expensive, but fresh."
"The service is not the most friendly for our ""big party""!"
Great Indian food
"Indian food was great. I love Indian food and I eat it very regularly, but I can say that this is one of the best I've ever eaten."
"""very normal Indian food, but very well done."
"I got a 4 instead of a 5 because of the price (only chicken tikka masala - no rice bread - is $25), which I would expect in a fancy Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have a sense of luxury"
"Plus, waiters try to get you to eat more, like suggesting things as if they're complimentary when they're actually $0."
"But if you're willing to spend a few dollars and remember to ask if anything they offer is free, then this is the place to go for Indian food."
"The bukhara grill, the slogan says it all... ""Indian spice raves""."
"The lunch buffet is expensive, but it's worth it."
"We've only been to dinner a few times, but the quality and service are the same."
Bukhara is one of my top five Indian places in New York.
I've never felt so disgusted by both meals and a service.
"However, once I received my predictable and mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks is a Korean parade (sometimes you have to be content when it's your only option), I spent half my kimchi before finding a random piece of lettuce accompanied by a much more disgusting, smooth, and clearly bad piece of fish skin."
"My main concern was the mental health of the food that was being sent to me and to others, but I would be lying if I said that as someone who worked in restaurants since I was 15 years old, I expected at least a minimal effort from the restaurant to make things better."
"My girlfriend, who was a little more aggressive, and who was disgusted that she had thrown away the rest of her meal just after she ate, called just to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was probably an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant."
"It wasn't like this restaurant had any big bragging points before, but now it's just repulsive."
A wonderful place for a romantic dinner
I booked a beautiful white organizational tent that included a four-course menu that we really liked.
"The service was spectacular, the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were incredible!"
I highly recommend Casa la femme for any special occasion and to impress your date.
"The bibimbap was medium, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sparkling."
Too bad I paid two more bucks for the stone bowl.
The nakgi-bokum was horrible.
The worst fried squid I've ever tasted.
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.
"The side dishes were passable, and I filled them on request."
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.
My wife had just touched that dish disaster.
"His wife ate the risotto, which was great."
Farro salad and Yukon potato purée were also extremely tasty.
I love the pizza from Margarita.
I love this place every time we're in town. This is one of the places we go all the time.
A slice of pizza from the quintessential NYC.
"The crust has a great bite and a good chewing, the sauce is light with a good acidity, the salt in the cheese is great, really increases the flavor of all the other ingredients."
"Personally, I like Margarita's pizza better, but they're all good."
Probably the most romantic restaurant in town.
"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (which doesn't serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!"
"It's not just an adventure to get to this place a little hidden once you walk through unmarked wooden doors, Zen decorum and intimacy will make you feel like you're no longer in town."
"If you're going to come here, make sure your date is someone you really like, as they'll take you to private cabins where there won't be people or food watching (choose those on the ground floor that have glass ceilings so you can see the stars in the sky!)."
It's just you and your date and a nice occasional apology before the waiter opens the curtain at your stand!
My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu which was a wonderful deal since it came with a sake flight too!
We started with a delicious sashimi amuse bouche.
"I picked the black grilled cod as my first meal, which I absolutely ate while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better."
The sake has made a nice compliment to the courses and is helping me get into the sake world.
"For desserts, we tried frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (green powdered tea) and blueberry cheesecake which was phenomenal."
"Maybe it was the big company (I had friends coming from Philadelphia) or the super reasonable price, but I can't say enough good things about this brewery."
"I don't usually visit the same factory more than once, or more than twice, but I'll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried, memorable dinner."
"Service leaves much to be desired, from feeling rushed to the place you order, to being ignored for the rest of the night."
"They're extremely rude, they don't apologize for the horrible service we've received and they give us a bill of over $500 for some drinks and their pita bread."
great shabu shabu
"I tried a couple of other dishes, but I wasn't very impressed."
"But for Shabu Shabu, you won't find anything better in New York."
"The meat is fresh, the sauces are excellent, you get the kimchi and a free salad with the meal and the service is good too."
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right hand of classic Korean food and fusion torches like pork belly tacos
"Hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason you're here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich perfect for your supermarket b-brownie squishy."
Restaurant with views
The food was very good.
Family seafood was very good.
The main entry was also very good.
"The price is high, but the food's good, so I'll be back."
This place doesn't make sense.
"This place has strange decorative stairs that climb up with broken walls, and I'm surprised no one's ever broken their head or fallen down the stairs."
This place is not inviting and the food is absolutely weird.
The Japanese tapas concept is just coming up and it's clearly not working.
"The food they serve is uncomfortable, unappetizing and uncooked."
Good food
"The food was good and tasty, but the seating was too small, I don't like being cramped in a corner."
It was a nice romantic place .
A colleague and I tried Pacific after work a few Fridays and we liked it.
The atmosphere was fantastic.
"The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say margaritas are something to write home about."
"Our maid was not bad, but she was not particularly warm or very attentive."
"I must say, I'm surprised by the bad reviews at the restaurant earlier this year."
"It doesn't matter, we'll be back and look forward to visiting in the summer to take advantage of the patio."
The servers at flatbush farm seem to have perfected that terrible technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for trying to get their attention.
"Another server increased the fun, throwing our appetizers in front of us halfway through our appetite (which was delicious)."
"Overall, the food quality was pretty good, although I've heard that salmon is much better when you haven't relaxed in front of the guest."
"The place has nice equipment, some attractive furniture and, as far as I can see, a list of reasonable wines (I was given the menu of food when I asked for the carte des vins)"
How do you keep this ball open?
Everything was fine until we had our meals .
I looked at the chicken and I got scared.
"It was served with leather, on a bed of extremely uncooked spinach and potato purée."
"I've only eaten a bite of 24-dollar salmon and in the 17 years I've been to restaurants, I've never tasted salmon as fishy, dry, bland as flatbush farms."
"At this point, the maid comes up to us and asks if everything's okay, I was literally so shocked I couldn't talk and I didn't say anything, and guess what, the maid left."
"So, I switched with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could digest the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so unripe that I couldn't bite."
"That's where it gets really bad: the manager said there's absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like, and I can't accept it."
"The manager came to the table and said we could do whatever we wanted, so we paid for whatever we liked, for drinks and appetites and we left."
This staff should be fired.
♪ I'm not sure ♪
It was a really good pizza.
The crust was incredibly well cooked and the pizza was completely loaded:):)
The worst restaurant in Manhattan.
"I have a couple of positive things: a nice decor, a good Pita and Hummus and a grey octopus hat, it was really delicious."
If I could give it a 0 star I would do it for this place
"This place, God, where do I start?"
It's a pretty spectacular scene.
"But the decor seems to be the distraction, so you won't notice that you just paid $300 for a cold tomato that took us two fucking hours to come!!!!"
"How this place survives the competitive market of the western village in this economy, or in any other, for that matter, I'm not familiar with."
Big hot dogs
"Even though it's been crowded most of the time I've been here, the tree always delivers their food."
"The hot dogs are top quality, and their slamwich is great!"
"It's always worth the train ride to whistle, and it'll make your tongue and belly happy!"
The only complaint is the price. I think it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less for every item listed on the menu.
"But anyway, big commercial big food"
fabulous food - if the front staff doesn 't put you to rest
"Every time we were there, the front staff (not the waiters, they're great, but the people who greet you and sit down) was so horrible for us that if it wasn't for the exceptional fish dishes I would never be back."
"Since BFC doesn't book, you almost always have to wait at the bar and be abused by front desk staff until you sit down, which can be more than an hour later!"
The back-flip girl will yell at you if you try to order a drink.
I'd be scared if my staff rejected clients so soon and so rude!
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" with brown hair, who listens to your conversation and makes you feel, except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're really *talking about*."
"Considering you're spending at least $60 a head, I expect better service."
"- ""Eat and go""."
"The food and service were good, but the maitre-d was incredibly rude and arrogant."
"As we finished our meals, which included a bottle of luxury wine, our son's boyfriend joined us for a glass of wine and a dessert."
"This guy refused to sit down, and she left, immediately followed by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of traveling the world, including Paris, I had never seen a show of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant."
"One word for the wise: you can't have dinner here and disturb the sense of turnover table, otherwise it's a little crazy."
Best meal in a long time!
The mussels and squid were great Saturday night.
"I had the special for the lamb, which was perfect."
"My father had the side steak that was very good, and my mother had the swordfish."
Four Seasons is a great experience.
The food is great and the environment is even better.
Taking hot dogs to the next level
"At first glance this place looks a little expensive for a hot dog joint, but barda doesn't just get your average hot dog."
Here the hot dog is high on the level of a real aperitif with many variations available.
The atmosphere is great
I highly recommend fish tacos.
"The cool atmosphere of the fire in the back is very interesting, but it needs some heat on a cold night."
Under service and management
Don't go to this place.
She had a terrible experience at Casa la femme at a Saturday dinner.
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.
I can't believe an expensive restaurant in NYC can be so disrespectful to its customers.
"The food is very good, but not exceptional."
"It is not possible that he justifies the honors he receives, the attitude of the staff or the waiting for a table."
"Mistakes happen, but they're usually accompanied by an excuse, maybe even a glass of wine, but not the grunt we got from Al Di La's staff."
"The bread was old, the salad was too expensive and empty."
"The pasta was well cooked, it didn't have enough sauce or flavor."
"The landlady was rude, and I had a feeling they didn't want to serve us."
"The only thing my friend left out was that when we sat down at the bar, the bartender disappeared."
"I asked for a menu, and the same maid looked at me like I was crazy."
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""I can help you"" and ""How many are at your party?"""
Shame on this place for the horrible staff and nonexistent customer service.
Personal bad
I generally like this place.
The food is good.
The design of the space is good.
But the service is horrible!
"I was there for the brunch recently, and we were tagged by a waiter and a waiter"
The waiter delivered the food to us with a plastic garbage bag in his hand.
"The waitress would come to check on us every few minutes and start cleaning the dishes while half of us were still eating (a big stone of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it)."
"I wish I could enjoy this place more, and I wish someone could reform the staff."
