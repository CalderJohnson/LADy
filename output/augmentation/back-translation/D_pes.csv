My daughter's waterfront wedding received the most praise from our guests.
All from Joe.
It was a wonderful service.
"Paul Mater D was a complete professional, and he always came back to everything."
Thank you for the water.
"Good service, but friendly, dirty bathroom."
"The high prices you want to pay for the view, not the food."
The drinks were good at the bar.
Talpia was terrible things... to your taste.
"We thought Deser was better, we were wrong!"
"Well, speaking of batteries, the men's battery was bad."
The wine list was extensive - although the staff did not seem to be aware of the wine's composition.
"The bread we received was terrible -- hard and cold -- and the olive oil ""free"" food was disappointing."
"However, our main course was great."
"I ate fish and my husband ate fillets, which both exceeded our expectations."
"Desser (We had a good wet cake - but, again, the staff was able to offer suitable drinks."
"When we asked about the ports, my attendant listed a few but didn't know what the eyes were or what the price was."
Not what I expected for the price and reputation of this place.
"Generally, I wanted to go back, because the restaurant was so nice, but I hope the staff will pay more attention to the little details in the future."
"It's a sweet, short session: it's romantic, it's beautiful, it's private."
They're not as small as they seem to be for two.
The service was super fast and attentive... because of the service button on your desk... but I barely understood a word when my servant ordered us.
The food was good and fair and nothing to go crazy about.
All the looks of this place have gone beyond the real promises.
So what you really pay for is not food.
Fine food and service.
"Pudding noodles, exactly the kind of food and service I enjoy."
"Servers are all different, my favorite wolf."
"Sometimes the tables don't understand his sense of humor, but it's refreshing to have a server that respects your personality, professionalism, and privacy at dinner."
"It's the first time a custom driver has ever mentioned it to him, and I hope he likes it because I have half the mind that I stole for my restaurant."
Prices are fair in all areas for food and drink.
"I want to go out and eat and I love my classes, the servers wait and never rush classes and make them drink another drink."
"Fresh and amazing dogs, but the best things are endless!"
"This house had all the clothes, and I mean, it was all..."
"Interesting and interesting for hot dog lovers of all ages, please make yourself a name and check this place out!"
Getting into Casa La Foume tonight was an experience unlike any other in New York.
I was so impressed with the decor and the food and the hospitality and the great night I had.
A great cocktail with cider vodka and lemon juice and the lemon leaves that's for his death.
It took a while to prepare and it was all worth the wait.
We were drawn to a belly dance show that attracted the crowd.
"I never write on these sites, but this restaurant is commendable."
Cream in the food.
"The menu was great and the waiter was great, but when the food came, it was average."
"However, I finished my dish and then I found a worm in the mushroom sauce downstairs."
"I showed it to his manager, and he apologized with a smile and gave us two free desserts."
The manager finally said he'd share two glasses of wine (which cost less than food) and that seemed like a big deal.
"I worked in restaurants and cooked a lot of food, and there's no way a worm can get a good cooked meal."
"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and usually very crowded, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service."
I got my hair in the food twice.
"Great place, great value."
"The food is delicious, abundant, and affordable."
The space is calm.
It's a great place to order or sit.
Sushi's experience with my fiancee was amazing.
Creative roles
Yamato is a great place to be if you don't like Sashimi or if you don't like sushi.
"They have great colorful rolls, and Norwegian rolls are amazing and filling."
"A special roll and a regular roll will fill you up, but keep it for dessert."
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert and a great green tea.
The glass is delicious!
It's great food.
In the tongue.
Good food.
"I had a fair share of modern Japanese, and this place works well."
But there was a little bit of a mirror he wanted to replace with a crazy mirror design.
"Despite the confusing mirrors, this will probably be my favorite modern Japanese food in the near future."
Indian Chinese food is very good...
"It's a nice place, but not very good, Indian food."
"Chicken lapis is my favorite, most of the food -- I must agree with a previous review -- is completely oily and very moist, especially chicken."
"My mother introduced me here, but she feels like food is a little more and more and more and more than that."
I was so sick of eating.
"I went to a dinner party at the restaurant, and the food was very disappointing."
"Instead of preparing vegetarian food, the cook offered me a steamed vegetable dish."
This place will only survive for fame.
"This is the best restaurant in all of New York City, not just Brooklyn."
"For seven years, they send out the best delicious food and keep it that way."
"Never set up, never eat bad food, never serve."
Great food on the list of great wines served in a great neighborhood.
Pizz Patties is true love.
Hands to the best pizza in the world.
Great hot dogs.
Dogs were thin and fluffy on the inside and funny enough on the outside.
Great gunpowder is definitely a place to check out for late dinner or a half-day boost!
"For me, the foods are low in fat, but the experience of eating is good."
"Useful service, average cost per container of $10."
The only thing you like is decoration.
Good food.
There's great Indian and Chinese food here.
"Be ready to wait, because it's too small."
"It's not pretty here, but the food speaks for itself."
"The best Indian Chinese city, after all!"
"I accidentally hit a rural basement, now I always go there."
Martini's great and affordable.
"The service was great, I had different waiters, and they were all very good, which is rare in New York."
"It's a great DJ. I was there for my birthday and I've been with my friends a few times, and I always come back."
Everything about me is great.
This office is really good.
"I wish it had something like this: your own home, your great food, your best level everywhere, it's definitely worth the wait."
But $500 for dinner for two people that didn't include wine?
"Look, the food was so good."
And the food was good.
You pay for the environment and the name.
"Yeah, it's fun and beautiful, but they're definitely aiming for Oberwil, not a regular Joe who wants to do everything, even if he's busy."
"Vinson was good, but he wasn't great."
"Still, the basin was great."
The pure disaster dessert.
"I read reviews that said the restaurant was too expensive, and I thought, maybe it's worth it."
"It's four seasons old and it's a New York City restaurant icon, but trust me, they're gonna ask you to say, ""I was at the restaurant for four seasons""."
"Overall, the food was great."
"It's a great environment, and you'll see a lot of rich people with trophy wives or just high-paid companions."
It's not worth it if you go for food.
"You think they'll trade it for service, unfortunately not."
It was good service. It's not what you'd expect for $500.
I agree that eating at Casa La Foum is like no other food experience!
"I actually just got home from seeing Casa La Fomba and I was so upset to see myself, I felt I had to try and warn other singers that they were worth their money and their time."
"We're late for the reservation, so I can't complain too much about waiting for the table."
It's beautiful here.
She was a very nice hostess.
But our $14 drinks were terrible!
"We asked Hoka six times, and the maid told us to take a minute and never came back with Hoka."
"I asked again after the fourth time, and the waiter said after dinner."
We asked the maid to confess she forgot to enter this custom section.
I was unedible because there were so many fat clubs I had to sit on my head.
I didn't expect him to pay $55 for dinner.
"When we left, we had a small wallet and a small stomach, and we missed the show we were supposed to see after dinner, which would have been acceptable if we had enjoyed the experience of good food and belly dancing!"
"If I could do that in there, I'd fight for my money because my dinner was not edible."
"I've never been out of a restaurant, I felt abused, and I wasted my hard earned money."
"It's very simple, without much description."
"That night, it wasn't the nano-water beer, which was disappointing."
It wasn't a bottle of beer. We went to Burma.
"The pre-orders we ordered were fast-paced -- a fried-steer order and the muscles were delicious, but a small portion (maybe three of each)"
"Lab hands were good, but they were very tasteless."
I think there were two shuttles in the salt shark.
"I had a roasted tai chi, which was really good."
Everyone seemed to like food except my brother who gave Mahie grapes in the juice.
I heard the rolls were great.
"All the food was good. A little expensive, but fresh."
Not a friendly service to our big party.
Great Indian food.
"The food was great - I love Indian food and I eat it regularly, but I can say that it's one of the best foods I've ever eaten."
"Indian food is very simple, but very well made."
"I'm getting $4 instead of $5, which I would expect at a top-selling Indian restaurant, but this place doesn't feel like a top-selling place."
"Also, the staff will try to give you more food, like suggesting that you do something like a meal, when it actually costs you $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$, which"
"But if you're willing to spend a few bucks and remember to ask them what they want from you, then this is the place to go for Indian food."
"The slogan of the Bhohara Girl is ""Indian Connections""."
"The coffee is expensive, but it's worth it."
"We've been to dinner a few times, but together, we've been offered this quality and service."
Bucharest is in the top five Indian places in New York.
I've never hated food and service so much.
"However, when I received my average, predictable order that Duckie thinks is a fair Korean one (you sometimes have to solve when it's your only option), I eliminated about half my kimchi before I found a random piece of salad that was accompanied by a much more unpleasant, sticky, completely bad fish skin."
"My main concern was the food health that was being sent to me and to others, but I'd be lying if I said that as someone who's been working in restaurants since I was 15, I expected at least a little effort from the restaurant to make amends."
"My girlfriend, who was a little more aggressive and she was able to get the rest of her food out of her mouth, just came back to know that I was probably wrong and that she was probably under siege and we were blacklisted from their restaurant."
"It's like this restaurant hasn't missed anything big for you, but it's just uncomfortable now."
A wonderful place for a romantic dinner.
I booked a beautiful white orange tent that included four prime periods and we enjoyed it.
The service was amazing because my servant knew everything about the menu and his advice was great!
I highly recommend Casa La Fumoni for any particular occasion and to really affect your date.
B.M.B. was a medium but a stone bowl was nowhere near his grip.
Too bad I paid an extra $2 for the bowl.
The Nagis Bokum was terrible.
Easily the worst fried Clark I've ever had.
The sauce was more like Chinese fast food than Korean.
"The side dishes were passable, and I filled them up."
My main problem here was the lack of full service.
My wife had barely touched that trash can.
"His wife ate the rizoto, which was amazing."
Salad Farrow and Yucca's were delicious.
I love the pizza Margarita. I love the pizza from the East Village.
We love it here every time we're in town. It's one of the places we always go.
A slice of pizza from NYC.
"It's got a good taste, it's good to eat, it's light and acidic, it's delicious cheese salt, it really enhances the taste of all the other ingredients."
"Personally, I like margarita pizza, but it's all good."
Probably the most romantic restaurant in town.
"This is without a doubt my favorite modern Japanese brassiere (which doesn't serve sushi) and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in town!"
"Not only does it get to this place when you walk into the unmarked wooden doors, but the decorations are close enough to make you feel like you're out of town."
"If you're going to come here, make sure your date is someone you really like because you're going to be directed to private rooms where no one is watching and food (choose the ones on the ground floor with glass ceilings so you can see the stars in the sky!)"
"Just you and your girlfriend and my daughter when you and your girlfriend are going to be together for a while, just a while, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit,"
"My party was for $29, which was great because it was a hot airline."
We started with a delicious sushi.
"I chose the fried sauce as my introduction, which I ate completely while someone said that the fried sauce was fried."
Skiing respected these courses very well and managed to get me into the ski world.
"For dessert, we tried frozen black tomatoes and matcha and blueberry cheese, which was great."
"Maybe it was a great company, or a really good price, but I can't say enough good things about this rice."
"I usually come to a place a few times, but every time I come to Zhenchiki for a quiet, peaceful dinner, you're a memory."
"Service leaves a lot to be desired, from feeling rushed to your place to ignoring the rest of the night."
"They're so rude, they won't even apologize for the terrible service we've had, and they'll give us more than $500 for a few drinks and their bread."
Shadow shadow.
"I tried a few other foods, but I wasn't very impressed."
But you can't get any better than Shabo Shabo in the Navy.
"Fresh meat, the sauces are great, you can have free kimchi and salad with your meal and the service is good."
"Duckie to Williamsburg, a couple of hits from classic Korean food and fusion ticks like pork tacos."
"The doughnuts are good, yes, but the reason we came here was because this was a great rabbit sandwich at the supermarket."
Restaurant with a view.
The food was delicious.
The family meal was very good.
And the main course was great.
"It's expensive, but the food's good, so I'm going back."
It doesn't make any sense here.
It's got a really weird staircase up here with mirrored walls. I wonder if anyone's broken their head or fallen down the stairs yet.
It's not inviting and the food is totally weird.
The Japanese concept of tapas is new and it's not working.
"The food they eat is not relieving, hungry, or unedited."
Good food.
"The food was delicious, but the seating was so small, I don't want to get stuck in a corner."
He said everything in a very romantic way.
A colleague and I experimented a few Fridays after work and fell in love.
The space was amazing.
"The food we ordered was great, though I don't want to say that Margaritas is something to be desired."
"Half our servants were not rude, but they were not very warm and attentive."
"I must say, I was surprised by the bad reviews at the restaurant earlier this year."
"Anyway, we're going back and we can't wait for summer to use the yard."
It seems that the Flatbush servers have perfected the awful way to make you feel guilty and ashamed to get their attention.
Another host added to the pleasure and dropped our food halfway through the amp (which was delicious) in front of us.
"Overall, the food quality was very good, although I've heard that fish are much better when they're not cold in front of guests."
"It's kind of a nice budget place, and I think it has a good wine list."
How is his hand still open?
Everything was fine until we had dinner.
I looked at the chicken and I panicked.
"Served with leather, on a bed of sponge and a very sparse-cooked potato."
"I've had a laugh at 24 dollar salmon, and in the 17 years I've been in restaurants, you can't give me the same amount of salmon that's sour, dry, and funny on the Bush flat farms."
"At this point, the waiter comes up to us and asks if everything's okay, I was literally shocked that I was silent and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waiter left."
"So I switched with my son's friend again to see if I could eat the spinach again, but the spinach was too low to bite."
"This is where it really gets bad: The manager says, ""We can't do anything, it's a taste that he doesn't like, and I can't get over it""."
"The manager came to the table and said, ""We can do whatever we want, so we paid for what we enjoyed, drinks and pre-meals, and we left."
These employees should be fired.
The pizza is Margarita.
The pizza was really good.
The skin was amazingly well cooked and the pizza was fully loaded:)
The worst one-man restaurant in Manhattan.
"I agree with a few positive things: nice decoration, good pasta, and homose and a hard-boiled hat."
"If I could give the stars, I'd be here."
Where do I start?
This is a great scene I want to give them.
"But it seems that decorating is a bit of a distraction, so you don't realize that you only paid $300 for a cold almond that took you two fucking hours to get here!"
How this place survives the competitive market of the West Village in this economy or anything else is beyond me.
Great births.
"Although it was very crowded, most of the time I was here, the cows always sent their food."
Hot dogs are great and their slimm wrists are great.
Going cowboy is always worth the train ride and it will make your tongue and stomach happy!
The only complaint is the price... I think I need a dollar less for everything that comes in.
But still-- the big big place is the big f food.
Great food - if the staff doesn't fire your front door.
"Every time we went, the front desk staff (not the servants - they're great - but the people who greet and sit down) were so terrible to us that if it wasn't for the exceptional fish dishes, I would never come back."
"Because BFC doesn't reserve you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by front desk staff until you're sitting down, which can be more than an hour later!"
The retro-fairy girl will yell at you if you try to order a drink.
I was afraid my staff would turn away customers so quickly and disrespectfully.
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" with brown hair, who listens to your conversations and listens -- except she only hears the last part of what you say, so her uninvited comments often go out of context and have nothing to do with what you're really talking about."
"Given that you spend at least $60 a person, I expect you to have better service."
"Metri, eat and go out."
"The food and service were good, but the teacher was incredibly unwelcoming and proud."
"When we finished a meal with a great bottle of wine, my son-in-law joined us for a glass of wine and dessert."
"The man refused to sit down and he left, and after a while, the four of us followed him, but before I told him that in 40 years of traveling the world, including Paris, I had never seen such bad behavior by a leader in a restaurant."
"One word to scientists: You can't have dinner here and lose the sense of ""table-turning"", no matter how crazy it is or not."
The best food in a long time.
The rats and the calaras were great on Saturday night.
I had a special sheep that was very good.
My father had a side steak that was very good and my mother had a swordfish.
Four seasons of restaurant is a great experience.
The food is great and the environment is even better.
They've taken Hot Dog to the next level.
"This place looks pretty expensive for a hot dog restaurant at first, but I'm not gonna just bite the hot dog."
"Here, the hot dog goes to the level of a real food with the variety available."
That's great.
I highly recommend fish tacos. Everything else is fine.
"The cool, volcanic air in the back room really does, but it needs more heat on cold nights."
Poor service and management.
Don't go in here.
We had a terrible experience at Casa la Femb on a Saturday night.
His manager was rude and he handled the situation very badly.
I can't believe how a high-end restaurant could disrespect Nick's customers so much.
"The food is great, but not great."
"There's no way to justify the praise he gets, the attitude of the staff or the expectations of a table."
"Mistakes happen, but they usually come with an apology, maybe a glass of wine, but not the cries we get from the Al-Dawla staff."
"The bread was gone, the salad was too expensive and empty."
"The pasta was good, but it didn't have enough sauce and flavor."
"It was a very rude host, and I felt bad that they wouldn't serve us."
The only thing my friend got out of it was that the bear disappeared while we were sitting in the bar.
"I wanted a me, and the other half looked at me like I was crazy."
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after Nandoz said, ""I can help you"", and ""How many people are at your party?"""
"I'm sorry to be here for the terrible, rude, customer service-free workers."
Bad workers.
I usually like it here.
It's good food.
The design is good.
But the service is terrible!
"I was there for lunch recently, and we were accompanied by a waiter and a waiter."
"The servant who delivered our food, what looked like a plastic garbage bag in one hand."
"Half of us were still eating, and he started cleaning the dishes."
I wish I liked this place better and someone would train the staff.
