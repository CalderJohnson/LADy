Fair prices around the world for both food and drink .
I go out to eat and I like my shift. The servants are patient and don't rush my shift or have to drink another drink.

The service was fine. Not what you expected for $500.

It was an unedible chicken where there were so many fat blocks that I had to spit in the grave.
I didn't expect that for a $55 dinner.
"When our wallet left, our stomachs were packed and we lost the show we were supposed to see after dinner, which was acceptable if we could enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancing!"
If I could do it while I was there I'd fight my bill because part of my dinner was not edible!
"I've never left a restaurant feeling like I've been abused, and I've lost all the money I've made so hard."
The list is too simple to describe.

"Indian food is very natural, but very well made."
"I have 4 instead of 5 because of the price (only chicken tica masala - no rice bread - is 25 dollars), which I expected in a high-performance Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have a high-performance feel"
"Also, waiters try to push you to more food, like suggesting things as if they're free when they actually cost you $1."
"But if you're willing to spend a few dollars and remember to ask if something you're offering is free, then this is the place to go for Indian food."
The slogan says it's all about the Indian Drugs Game.
"Lunch is expensive, but it's worth it."

I 've never been so disgusted with both food and service .
"However, once I received my average order that Duckby thought was offering Korean (sometimes you have to settle when the only option is), I got half a kimchi before I found a piece of random authority accompanied by a little fish skin that was clearly scary, spicy and bad."
"My main concern was the health of the food that was being sent to me and others, but I would be lying if I said that as someone who has been working in restaurants since I was 15, I would expect at least a small effort from the restaurant to change the situation."
"My friend, she was a little more aggressive, and she was just as disgusting, so I made her throw away the rest of the meal that I barely ate, so I just called to let her know that I might have been wrong,"
"This restaurant didn't have any big points to brag about before hand, but now it's just disgusting."
It 's a great place to have a romantic dinner .

Too bad I paid an extra dollar for the stone jar.
The captain was terrible.

The sauce looked more like Chinese fast food than Korean sweet.
"The side dishes are overlapping, and I get refilled on request."
The real problem I had here was the lack of a full service.
My wife barely touched this mess of dishes.
"My wife was eating risotto, which was amazing."
The Faroese salad and the broken yucca porridge were also very fresh.

I love this place. This is one of the places we always go.
That 's a great slice of pizza .
"The bark has a great bite and a good chewing, a light sauce with its sweet acid, and a great salt of cheese, really adds to the flavor of all the other ingredients."

Probably the most romantic restaurant in town.
"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese restaurant (no sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in town!"

Just you and your partner and sometimes a nice excuse before the waiter opens the little curtain into your room.
"We had a BB29 list, which was so great because it also came with a plane of sake."
We started with Sashimi . It 's fun .
"I chose roasted black fish as my food, which I ate completely while someone said that roasted salmon was better."
Saki did well on the courses and managed to get me into the world of Saki.
"At the dessert, we tried frozen black sesame banana (interesting but not unusual) and matcha (green tea powder) and pepper cheese cake, which was amazing."
"Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting me from Philadelphia) Yeah, it wasn't a date this time) or the very reasonable price, but I can't say good enough things about this drink."
"I don't usually visit the same facility more than once, that is, more than twice, but I'll come to Zincchi anytime for a quiet, unhurried, memorable dinner."
"Service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you're in a hurry from where you ordered, to ignoring the rest of the night."
"They're so rude, they don't apologize for the terrible service we've received and they give us a bill over $500."

The family seafood meal was very good.
And the main course was very good.
"The price is high, but the food's good, so I'll be back."
This place means nothing.
This place has weird fashion grades going up with mirror walls. I'm surprised how no one broke their head or fell down the stairs.
This place is not motivating and the food is completely strange.
The Japanese concept of the tapis is new and obviously not working.
"The food you serve is not comfortable, not cooked, not a kitchen."
Good food .
"The food was delicious, but the place I was sitting was so small, I don't like to be cornered."

My partner and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and we loved it.
It was great.
"The food I ordered was excellent, though I wouldn't say margaritas is something you could write about at home."
"Our waitress wasn't bad, but not too warm or fancy either."
"I have to say I'm surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier this year, though."
"However, we'll be back and we can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the yard."
It seems the servants at Flash Bush Farm have acquired this awful technique that makes you feel guilty and ashamed to manipulate to get their attention.
"A different waiter enhanced the fun , and put our food in front of us halfway through our appetite (which was delicious)."
"Overall, the food quality was very good, although salmon was much better when it didn't sit cooling in front of the guest."
The place has a nice setup some attractive furniture and from what I can tell the wine list is reasonable.
How is this key still open?
Everything was going well until we got our meals.
I looked at the chicken once and I was scared.
"It was served with leather, on a bed of very uncooked spinach and fried potatoes."
"I've had one piece of salmon that costs $24 and I've never tasted salmon like fish in 17 years, like fish, like dry, like those on the Flash Bush farms."
"At this point, the waitress comes in and asks us if everything's okay, you're literally so shocked that you're without a word and say nothing, and guess what, the waitress went away."
"So I picked up my friend again to see if I could eat meat and spinach again, but the spinach was too uncooked."
"This is where it really gets bad: the manager says, there's nothing we can do, it's just a matter of taste, she didn't like it, and I can't stand it."
"The manager came to the table and told us to do what we wanted, so I paid what we enjoyed, drinks and appetites and went out."
This employee should be fired.
The Serpent ball is Margarita Pizza.
It was a really good pizza.
The shell was perfectly cooked and the pizza was fully loaded.
One of the worst restaurants in Manhattan.
"I'll be with some positives, good decor, good beta, good beta, good homo, and the grilled hotbus cup was delicious."
"If I could give you 0 stars, I'd do it for this place."
"This place , my God , where do I start ?"
It 's a very spectacular scene . I 'll give it to them .
"But the decor seems to be the focus, so you won't notice that you only paid $300 to buy some cold oranges that took two fucking hours to arrive."
"How this place survives the competitive market of the western village in this economy, or anything else in that regard, is out of my league."
The great hot dogs.

"Hot dogs are first class, and they're amazing slimmies!"
"Going to mourn is always worth riding a train, and you'll make his tongue and stomach very happy!"
The only complaint is pricing -- I think it would be reasonable to pay less for every item on the list.
"But still , it 's a great place ."
"- Great food. - If the housewives don't have to stop you,"
"Every time we were there, the house staff were not the waiters, they're great, but the people who call you and sit down are so disgusting to us."
"And BFC doesn't book, you always have to wait at the bar, and you get assaulted by the house staff until you sit down, which may be more than an hour from now!"
"The beautiful, beautiful girl with the winged Edna glasses will yell at you if she tries to order a drink."
I'd be terrified if my staff were to reject clients so early and harshly!
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" with brown hair, who listens to your conversation and steps in -- but she only hears the last part of what you say, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're talking about."
"Given you're gonna lose at least $60 for a guy, I expect better service."
"""Eat and go""."
"The food and service were good, yet the manager was incredibly unwelcome and arrogant."
"As we finished our meal with a bottle of high-quality wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and sweets ."
"The man refused to sit with her and she left, followed shortly after by the four of us, but not until I told him in 40 years of traveling around the world, including Paris,"
"Word of wisdom: You can't have dinner here and disturb the manager's sense of ""turning around the table"", as crazy as he is, otherwise."
Best meal in a long time .
The joke and the lyrics were great Saturday night.
I had my own pregnancy that was perfect.
"My father had a meat pie that was very good, and my mother had a swordfish."
Four Seasons is a great experience.
The food is great and the environment is better.
Take hot dogs to the next level.
"At first glance, this place looks a little expensive for a hot dog shop, but when you vibrate, you don't get your regular hot dog."
"Here, hot dogs rise to the level of real food with many variations available."
It 's a great air .
I highly recommend tacos. Everything else was fine.
"The cold weather in the fireplace in the back really does indicate it, but it needs more heat all night on a cold night."
Bad service and management .
Don't go to this place.
I had a terrible experience at Casa La Vimpe on Saturday night.
The manager was rude and managed the situation very badly.
I can 't believe how a New York restaurant could be so disrespectful to its customers .
"The food is very good, but not special."
"There's no way to justify the effort you're getting, or the staff stand or the waiting table."
"Mistakes happen, but they're usually accompanied by an apology, maybe even a glass of wine... but not the remorse we've received from the De-No employees."
"The bread was old, the salad was too expensive and empty."
The pasta was good. It didn't have much sauce or flavor.
The hostess was rude and I felt like they didn 't want our service .
The only thing my friend missed was when we sat down at the bar.
I ordered the menu and the same waitress looked at me like I was crazy.
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""Can I help you?"" and ""How many people are at your party?"""
Shame on this place for the ugly staff and the nonexistent customer service.
Bad employees .
I generally like this place.
The food is good.
The space design is good.
But the service is terrible.
"I was there for lunch recently, and we were hanging out with a waitress and a maid."
The waiter was serving our food while he was holding in one hand what looked like a plastic bag of garbage.
"The waitress would come to check us out every few minutes, and she started cleaning the dishes while half of us were still eating."
I wish I liked this place better and I wish someone would train the staff.
