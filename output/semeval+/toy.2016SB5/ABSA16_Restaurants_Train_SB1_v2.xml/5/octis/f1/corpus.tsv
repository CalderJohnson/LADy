food was okay, nothing great.	train
service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!	train
i have eaten at saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.	train
the food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.	train
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.	train
ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.	train
the wine list is interesting and has many good values.	train
went on a 3 day oyster binge, with fish bringing up the closing, and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended, because it was so great!	train
avoid this place	train
judging from previous posts of test this used to be a good place but not any longer.	train
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn.	train
the food is decent.	train
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.	val
chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family.	val
i/we will never go back to this place again.	val

the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.	test
