"My options: guizhou chicken , fish with hot bean fountain , fish steak with spicy fountain (special menu)."
"Overall, I'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are pretty decent but, again, its Chinatown."
"It's true that some nights inside the restaurant were quite warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm."
The pizza was a little wet.
"The food includes famous Bombay-style chats like bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa , as well as other great Indian snacks ."
The Singapore Mai fun didn't taste like curry.
The only problem is the manager is a complete incompetent.
The wine list is interesting and has many good values.
I 'm still angry that I had to pay for a terrible meal .
This restaurant used to be our usual place for Thursday dinner .
Definitely go if you're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad.

"No more reservations , expensive tips and annoying things ."
Try the seafood .
$20 gives you unlimited sushi of very high quality -- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the United States that I've ever been.
The sushi wasn 't spectacular at all for the price .
"During our meal , the management came to see us and even bought us a few drinks ."
"But they don't have a toaster, which is weird."
"So, for good food, I'd recommend it, but not for a fun night."
The menu options are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.
It's a must for all dosa lovers.
"The portions are huge, so it might be good to order three things to divide (instead of an appetizer and an appetizer per person) for two people."

The exotic food is very well presented and is a pleasure in delicious combinations.

People are always nice.

"It was nice and cool, but I can't give you high marks on being authentic Thai."

"They only serve wine and beer, but the house varieties are pretty good."
This place must have cost the owners a fortune to build.
And the free pudding dessert was enough... delicious!
We shared a tasty vegetable samosa and malai tikka wrapper .
The chef and the waitress know less than average.
We were walking around town and we just walked into this place for a few drinks .
Also a decent selection of wines.
"Save walking and waiting for a table at the bar, which is often noisy and crowded at dinner time."
"I have to say, I've never had a disappointing meal here."
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (the raddichio was a little bit bitter though).
"The disappointing food , the terrible service ."
"If you want a casual bistro that has good food and excellent service, this is the place."
A good place to go for a drink because they have 100 kinds of beer .
For the price and small portions .
"Meanwhile, the bartender continued pouring champagne from his reservation after we finished our bottle and enjoyed a free snail soup fun with basil puree."
The food was well prepared and the service impeccable.
"But their best dish is the Thai curry knot with shrimp -- a dish that would cost $23.95 in most places, but here it's $16."
It's a very dark environment and the music is very pleasant.
"My husband said the portions were very small, but if my main dish was good for eating the portion would have been good for me."
But Thai is definitely not great... soft and indistinguishable.
"It's great for groups, for a date, for an early brunch or a late night drink."
Our kindly waiter made great food suggestions and also sent the sommelier and the tea to the table to help suggest different couples for wine and cheese .

The food was absolutely amazing!!
Some waiters make you feel like they 're doing you a favor to bring you food .
"An excellent alternative to fast food and shopping for food, but the food was a little disappointing."
The Mermaid Hotel is a good restaurant with very good seafood .
The staff is also attentive and kind.
The deal of everything you can eat is really amazing here.
"That 's a problem , since we paid about 20 bucks a plate , and we had to order 5 plates to get a decent taste ."
It was a scam ($8.95 for four steamed meat chips) and it's not worth trying.
All the pizzas are fantastic and the price is even better!
"It's about food and the environment, and imagine how terrible it will be that we just have to listen to a leisurely engine."
The food was good too.
"Right after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys get out of here."
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to scream. How refreshing!
"It's true this is not the place for huge pieces of fish to overflow from the plate (and thank God, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there's no better place in New York or anywhere else in the United States."
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways to prepare them.
The white bean pudding to start with was amazing and the pasta was phenomenal.
The rest of the menu is limited by all the good things you eat .

"And forget what you've read under me, the atmosphere's not so bad either."
"We couldn't continue our conversation because it was routinely interrupted by waitresses and waitresses asking us to order and insinuating that we were taking too long -- amazingly, we sat down."
Sometimes I have good food and good service .
"It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, noise and the opportunity to be with their bridge and tunnel buddies."

"You'd think we'd apologize or get free drinks, but we have a snobbie waiter who doesn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us a lip when we asked him to."
"In fact, we gave him a 10% tip (which we never did despite the poor food and service) because we felt totally stolen."
We were expecting a nice glass of blood when we got there.
I 'd recommend a table by the window .
"While enjoying the meal, we were very disappointed by the poor service (the waiter was not very competent and the service was slow) and the lack of remorse."
"The service, however, was a shining flower in a garden."
We've been to the supermarket three times and not once has he let down an item on the menu.

"I don't know about you, but when I go out to eat, I go for the food, not the environment."
They should have called it Mascarpone with s-good chocolate but far from what the name implies.
"A gentleman, perhaps the manager, came to our table, and without a smile or a greeting asked for our order."
"We were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to start ordering snacks."
I 've had pizza and the caprese salad snack .
"I was very thirsty after dinner, too."
"I wasn't there for the half-price Saturday night special, but Tuesday night."
"If you like the food and the value you get from some Chinatown restaurants, this is not the place for you."
The selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available.
Get the soup and a pastrami sandwich for $8 and it's gold.
I have to say if this makes it easier to get a saet a lunch - I don't care.
My family and I ate here last night for our annual Christmas dinner with family members who prefer to spend their holidays with friends out of town.
I grew up with these bagels .
They told us they were booked and there was no other table available.
"The restaurant is very small, so you need to book."
"To my right, the hostess stood on top of a busboy and whistled fast, fast as she tried to clean and re-position a table for six."
"After dealing with a low-end pizza all over the Kensington neighborhood, I found little tuna."
Then we ordered a dinosaur string and a white tuna sashimi .
I 'm partly into gnocchi .
They got me in at 6:00 after I called the night before my birthday to book a Friday night and they said they'd treat us well for the occasion.
"Please note they do not serve beer, you must bring your own."
We ate outside at Haru's sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.
"The service was typical of short-order, dinner-type."
"We shared a bottle of sake , an order from Edamames , and she ate the sushi dish while I ate the sashimi ."
I can't believe people complain about not having cheese sticks.
"From the snacks we ate, the sum of the diet and other varieties of food, it was impossible to criticize food."
"Each table has a pot of boiling water sunk on its surface, and you get dishes of cut meat, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles."
