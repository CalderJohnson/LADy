"Maybe more crowded for lunch , seldom crowded for lunch ."
"Their looks are terrible, bad, causing vomiting, Yoke."

The same beautiful bar scene seems to be happening.
"Saturday, November 6th, I had a group of work come in with about 35 people and the staff were amazing at catching up with us."
"Good products, excellent options for drinks and very fresh snacks."
"First, the waiter who was serving us ignored our announcement of the specials I would have chosen if I had known about them."
"Also, cover the meal with a delicious, perfect piece of teramizo."
Check the secret back room .
"It's also connected to Angel's share, a more romantic, cold bar."
"They have real service, not just the crutches you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door."
Stick to the gems .
"I 'm surprised by the poor tourist ... find this place to be an excellent Italian in an area full of Italy ... great prices , great atmosphere , good service and great wine menu ."
I was in touch with the restaurant at the table behind me and the cleaners had to lift the plates over our heads.
"With the theater two minutes away , I had a delicious meal in a beautiful room ."
"I only ate at the restaurant once, but we ordered dinner several times."
So far this is the only place for Chinese food I know in New York or anywhere near northeastern America that offers meals with frog oil in two varieties.

"The food is usually good, but it's definitely not a comfortable place to go."
"Nice, very knowledgeable staff, a great pastries meal, a great coconut lunch with a great live coconut."
The prices were great.
"However, any dispute over the bill was compensated by your own measures of silence from drinks that were respectable from home..."
"Table service could have been more interesting, but as someone who also works in the service sector, I realized they were busy."
"Not interesting, but for me, Thai food has never been and will never be."
"The food was also very good, considering we tried to pick a budget (although I wish the pig's belly I ordered was a little longer, even the fat was more of an experience than melting in your mouth)."

The service is first class.
The food is not consistent now.

"The menu choices are similar, but the taste was more lacking than it seemed."
It must be for all the lovers of the world.
"The shares are huge, so it might be good to ask for three things to share (instead of one meal for each person) with two people."
The appetizers were good and the main course was too small.

And we split up some delicious samosa vegetables and Mali Teka files .
The knowledge of the chef and the utility are below average.
We were walking around the village and I just walked in here for a few drinks.
Choosing the right wine too .
Walking in and waiting at a table in a crowded bar often saves you from the noise of dinner.
I must say I didn't have a disappointing meal here.
I had a little burnt but it still tastes good with goat cheese and panchetti.
Bad food and bad service .
"If you want a regular local parsley with great food and excellent service, this is the place."
Great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer.
"It 's more than the required amount , and the small parts ."
"Meanwhile, the waiter continued to pour his spare champagne after we finished our bottle and enjoyed a fun rennet soup with the fried basil, for free."
The food was well prepared and the service was clean.
"But their best dish is curry-cooked Thai pies with shrimp -- a dish that will cost $23.95 in most places, but $16 here."
"The dark, moist air is a nice touch."
"My husband said the part was too small, but if my main course was good for eating, the part was good for me."
But the Thai is definitely not great -- very kind and unusual.

The staff are also communicative and valley-bound.
All you can eat is really amazing here.
"That 's a problem because we pay about 20 bucks for the dish , and we had to order five to get a decent taste ."

"Of course, this is not the place for a huge piece of fish to go over the plate (and thank God, in my opinion) but for a simple sushi, the snack is no better place in New York or anywhere else in the United States."
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways to prepare them.
The British white spots were great and the pasta was great.

And forget what you read. The atmosphere's not bad either.
"We couldn't keep up the conversation because the waitresses and waitresses were routinely intersecting and asking us to order and hinting that we were taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down."
Sometimes I get good food and good service.

I highly recommend ordering a table by the window.

But the service was a bright flower in a garden.
We went to the grocery store three times and nobody was disappointed.
