"The food is mostly ground-breaking, fresh and well prepared."
"Worse, $60 was wrongly added to our $80 bill."
"No more reservations , expensive tips and annoying stuff ."
Try the sea bass .
20 bucks gives you unlimited sushi of very high quality -- I even brought a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US he'd ever visited.
The sushi wasn 't spectacular for the price .
"During our meal , the managers came by and checked us out , even bought us a drink ."
"But they don't have a toaster, which is weird."
"Well, for a good meal, I'd recommend it, but not for a fun evening."
"The menu selection is similar, but the taste wasn't as good as it looks."
A must for all the Dosa lovers.
"The portions are huge, so it would be good to divide three things (instead of one starter and a side dish per person) for two people."
The starter dishes are fine and the main dishes were definitely bad.
Someone recommended the dessert.
The exotic food is beautifully presented and enjoyed in delicious combinations.
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table .
"Try the Mediterranean salad , it 's a real experience for your taste buds !"
People are always friendly.
The cream cheese is from this world and I love this coffee !

The service was quick and polite.

"It was nice and fresh, but I can't judge it to be authentic Thai."
"I've got soda, filled with ice cream, no lemonade."
"It's only wine and beer, but the home variants are actually pretty good."
This place must have cost the owners a lot of money.

We 'll share a delicious vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap .
The knowledge of the cook and the waitress is below average.
We were in the village and we went in here to get a drink .
A decent selection of wine.
"It saves you when you walk in and wait for a table for dinner in the often noisy, crowded bar."
"I must say, I've never had a disappointing meal here before."

About price and small portions .
"The bartender poured champagne from his reserve after drinking it, and we enjoyed a fun soup with basil, free of charge."
The food was well prepared and the service was impeccable.
"But their best dish is the shrimp-themed Thai curry noodles -- a dish that costs $23.95 in most places, but here it's 16."
The atmosphere is dark and the music is a beautiful touch.
"My husband said the portions were very small, but if my main course was good to eat, the portion would be fine for me."
But Thai is definitely not great -- weak and unrecognizable.
"Ideal for groups, ideal for a date, ideal for an early brunch or dinner."
Our friendly server made good food suggestions and also sent the sommelier and the cheese maker to the table to beat different pairs for wine and cheese .
"We had no reservation, so we could only sit in the backyard, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather."
Even filling with Japanese food is rare.
"While the food was good (not Il Mulino), the service was terrible."
Service isn 't what you 'd expect from a joint in this price range .
Our family never expected to have such incredible conversation.
I'd recommend you book on the weekend.
It's a great place for pizza lunch.

I noticed it was cropped on the bill .
The best dish is nori-packaged tuna .
The food was absolutely fantastic!!
Some servers make you feel like they 're doing you a favor to bring you the food .
"An excellent alternative to fast food and orders, but the food was a bit disappointing."
The Mermaid Hotel is a good restaurant with really good seafood .
The staff is also attentive and friendly.
Everything you can eat here is really amazing.
"That 's a problem , because we paid about 20 bucks a plate and ordered five dishes to get a good taste ."
You were such a failure ($8.95 for four little steamed meat pies) and it's not worth trying.
All the pizza is great and the price is even better!
"It's about food and atmosphere, and imagine how terrible it would be if we had just heard an empty machine."
The food was good too.
"As soon as we paid, the waiter took the money and said, ""Okay, you're gone""."
"The dining room is quietly elegant, without shouting music."
"I want to tell you that this is not the place for huge fish that go over the plate (and thank God, I think), but for simple, elegant sushi, there's no better place in New York or anywhere else in the United States."
The menu seemed to have a variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways to prepare them.
The white bean bruschetta was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal.
The rest of the menu is limited to anything but good food .
The menu's not like the website.
"Great food , great equipment , great service ."
I asked a car operator for a lotus leaf of rice and she answered for rice and just left.

The taste is great and the menu is extensive.
"The food was fantastic, the service was so attentive and personal, and how about the ambience!"
"This place has the best interior I've seen north of W'burg, and it will impress who you bring there."
The food's been constant for years and it never lets you stop.
I found the variety of sashimi dishes satisfying - fresh and delicious.
And forget what you read under me.
"We couldn't continue our conversation because we were routinely interrupted by waitresses and waitresses who asked us to order and suggested that we were taking too long -- amazingly, we just sat down."
Sometimes I get good food and good service .
"It's a place for people who pay a lot for average food, noise, and the chance to be with their colleagues in brothers and tunnels."
"After we complained about the chicken cabinet, the manager came to us and said that no one had ever complained before and that we just didn't know how the dish should taste."
The food was spicy and delicious.
I was at a lunch party last night .
The bartender couldn 't separate from his friends at the bar .
"If you're around to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time looking for something, but rather walking down the street over Tamari."
Dahkin also offers a price-fixed lunch and buffet .
"Although the place has a little more attention and space, it's not really important at the same time."

A great place to get a hot bagel on the way to work.
"It's like they took the rest of the chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder on it (the sauce was clear and red)."
"You'd think we'd apologize or get free drinks -- instead, we had a snobby waiter who wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and give us lip service when we asked him to."
We gave 10% tip (which we never did despite the average food and service) because we felt completely cheated.
We were looking forward to a glass of Sangria when we arrived.
I recommend a table by the window .
"While we enjoyed the meal, we were very disappointed by the poor service (the waiter was not very competent and slow service) and the lack of remorse."
But the service was a bright flower in a garden.
We've been to the grocery store three times and never disappointed a single item on the menu.
"The food is also very good, but mostly it's just normal food, nothing special."
A little more Jalapeno for contrast and it would have been really good.
"I tried the pad on the last critic 's recommendation , as it 's one of my favorite dishes ."
"We ate outside in the backyard, which is worth it, because it's cool and the music is good."
This place is perfect.

The special is an asbolute steel.
The food is Asian-fusion.

"When you're here, you'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it's just in time."
"We were on our way to New York, and since I'm in New York, we were wondering why we couldn't eat something."
The expensive sandwiches are overcrowded - they can easily serve two people and so cheaply!
Services and food is what everyone expects when they spend this kind of money.
I love the atmosphere.
Each course was better than the next.
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive.
"If presentation and service are your thing, then this magic show works."
- Then the good cook seems to be working.

I had shellfish oreganta and a spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil .

Why people cheer for the atmosphere .
I was having a drink with friends at Lafayette 161 and happened to be in front of the Thai Angel Famine.

It's a great sushi experience.

The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive (because we were the only ones in the first few hours).
"From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waiter, I felt like a king and enjoyed every second."
"This food may be considered extreme for an Upper East Side resident, but for the rest of us who have eaten ethnic food, it's just boring."

"My choice is: - Skalion pancake (packed with vegetable juice, very special and delicious) - Guizhou chicken - crushed squid family style (one of my personal favorites) - Sichuan melting crab - Shuizhu fish (this is for hardcore Sichuan fans, I wouldn't recommend it to my American friends because it's very narrow)."
They smell like old canned spinach soap calzone .
"To celebrate a birthday, the three of us went to Maren and waited for a good meal."
There was a big deal for six blue-peas and a beer or a glass of wine for eight dollars!
I liked the noodles on Rice Avenue compared to their green curry dish .
"But for whatever reason, the prices are about twice as high."
"I'm relatively new to the area and I tried to pick a bell on the second, was disappointed with the service and thought the food was excess and on the expensive side."
It's a great feeling and worth it.
"The spicy tuna scrolls were unusually good and the rock shrimp Tempura was fantastic, a great starter to share!"
The staff was knowledgeable and full of personality.
- Great staff .
"The only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12 to $ 15 a meal , I wouldn 't have to worry about the seat !"

"A cool place to hang out with friends , have some healthy drinks and desserts ."
"- Very well, a lot of people."
"I like Mamun's food, too, but side by side, Kati Rolls just makes delicious food."
"The service is a little slow, but it reminds me of my years growing up in Naples, Italy, where it's not rushed and when you sit down for dinner, the table is yours all night."

There's good food and the prices are very reasonable.

A cool bar with good food and tons of excellent beer .
Try the seasonal and always delicious specialities.

"The drinks were screwed up, she kept herself on the line."
The unique vegetarian parade was actually a surprise - it was delicious and had winter melons covering a selection of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .
You can't go wrong with five dumplings for a dollar.
But the pizza is too expensive.
"And the staff is young, energetic and hot too!!!!"
You can cook French classics like Poivre's steak and Onglet without burning them or overcooking them.
"The service was decent, but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these prices and reputation."
We had a wonderful meal in Naples 45 a month ago.
- It 's good to drink .
A good meal (spinach and corncake and massamman carrie) very friendly and without crap and a clean and funky bath .
We had a girl dinner for restaurant week.
I was at a work dinner recently when a colleague from London noticed a large waterworm on the ceiling.
My food was fun and eating was really slim and fat.
"Although I booked dinner at the dinner broker at 3 p.m., we were sitting at a table with one of the best views!"
"We noticed, however, that some tables had something that looked like pita instead of naan."
"I didn't look at the rest of the menu, but the oysters were fantastic."
The grilled cheese at home was better after that.!!
"The red sliding doors are unique, but they do not block the cold air from the outside."
- Very good . - Good .
"The food is expensive, but it's worth every bite."
"Sometimes I get bad food and bad service , sometimes I get good good service and bad service ."

We had to wait at the bar.
"If you love seafood , you 'd love this place !"
- Good service and quick.
They're constantly charging different prices.
"I was in love with Pongsri, but compared to Suan, it's slow and expensive."
My friends and I had a fantastic cheese last night and a delicious new summer menu at Artisanale.
"It's charmingly small, and that creates an atmosphere that's extremely cozy and romantic."
It 's obvious that no one at the restaurant has any idea or experience of Japanese cuisine .
"As for the food itself -- nothing special, we've limited ourselves to several flavoring additives."
I love the jazz bands on Fr and Sat.
"When we started, we were told we had to wait 30 minutes and we were about to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our phone when the table was ready."
The servers will give you some samples of your order while you wait (short I could add).
The service was fine.
"When asked how a particular dish was prepared compared to a similar one in other Thai restaurants, he replied that this is not a McDonald's, every place does things differently, while it is understandable that every place is actually different, there was no need to be rude to customers and obviously rude."
"I'm not afraid you can sit inside, there's only a few tables and they're always full."
"The staff is good, the atmosphere exciting yet relaxing, and the food is out of this world!"
"The food was delicious (I had a Halibut special, my husband had steak) and the service was top notch."
"The manager claimed he couldn't make up for the bill, which only shows the lack of refinement of the whole group."
It 's the only place you can get good authentic Japanese comfort .
"We made a profit on the half-price sushi deal on Saturday, so it was worth it."
"We arrived on a busy Saturday night and sat down immediately , although we were 15 minutes late for our reservation ."
"We quickly ordered the pre-food, as we were very hungry."
The staff are attentive and have a smile on their faces.
"No dress code, no attitude, a lot of comfort, a great place to relax in a busy city centre."
"The biggest and freshest sushi ever, and it's delicious!"
The pasta is delicious here too (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).
"But when we looked at the menu, there weren't many options, most of them were dumplings in the front desk."
"Maybe I'm saying this because it looks promising to people who like Jewish arterial blockage, but it turns out to be poorly managed and terrible."
"After my third time, the manager remembered me and treated me like a regular customer."
If only they could get a toaster .
"If he doesn't make authentic Neapolitan pizza in open brick ovens or lightly fried zucchini flowers, he visits regular customers (a growing legion) and checks out the newcomers."
"The warehouse is unhappy with your business, but it's the best cake in the world!"
"The ingredients taste fresher, the crust thinner and sticker, the disk less greasy, and it never burns, as it does occasionally at Joe's."
Fish is so fresh.
Prices were low compared to the quality of services and food .
"The best place in town for Vietnamese classics, better than places that cost a lot more."
I'm waiting for less!
"The decor is really blue, and not hip or passing at all."
"After we discovered ping on the Internet, we went in with some hesitation, but were immediately relieved by the fish tanks that greet you when you entered."
It seems to be the owner's first business and it shows.
"I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Forvinos is knocking out my family's receipts."
"We ordered beef and noodles from the Thai menu, but nothing we got was Thai."
You have a wide selection of different cream cheeses and all their salads are great.
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with shells and shrimp is great.
The food was authentic.
"The dim sum is pleasant, while the prices on the wallet are fairly simple."
"I just tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce, but it actually went better than most Italian joints I've tried similar dishes in New York."
The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever met.
I ordered a chicken teriyaki dish and found out the chicken was extremely dry.
"We had a reservation at 9:00, but I wasn't seated until 10:15."
We had some special fried fish for Pam and it was fantastic.
There 's no excuse for such a bad service !
"My friend had the New England Chowder , and it was good , but I think the price should go to the lobster ."
"So, a little inequality, but either way, both pizzas were really good."
"The restaurant is more expensive overall than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious."
Not enough wine in the glass.
I had the Entebrust special last time and it was amazing.
"I have to say, it's a little expensive for the food, because it wasn't as spectacular as the view."
These innovators of French Indian fusion are doing a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while they're accessible.
I've seen a woman stabbed 40 times.
No tricks here - the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.
"We were afraid we would have trouble coming, but somehow we managed to have a short wait."
"My wife had the fried shrimp, they're huge, and they loved it."
You shouldn 't go on a fortune strike to get the food .
"The last time I was there, we were told they needed our table, so we have to go."
We could only go through a snack and a cheese fondue .
Both times we waited for more than half an hour for a table (though we had reservations).
"We had to wait in the bar for a while, but the manager was so nice and made our waiting a great experience."
Try the green curry !!!
We had the shells as a starter and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
We were also very fast when we booked and the service was very fast and professional.
"You rarely have to wait for a seat and the curries (masaman, green, red) are full of flavor and come in super spicy if you ask."
The food there is devastating.
I highly recommend you visit this restaurant and eat and drink !
The bar is very well equipped with interesting beers and well-priced wines .
"Last Memorial Day, I tried to make reservations, but I said they're closed this weekend."
The food was good.
"A good selection of wine, gigondas are worth the price, and champagne is a great value."
But it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for the same luxury - the background music is also voluminous.
I enjoyed everything I've ever had and the fish is so fresh and always well prepared.
I love her yellow tunes and her shell selection .
I like to visit Murray's for my bagel fix.
We booked early dinner and were very impressed. Reminds me of my grandfather. His old school admiring Italian landscape with many fun things.
It was nice and quiet.
Cheese is a diverse pleasure and a great deal for $10.
I could have had four glasses of water and still be dry.
We had a quick service.
"Most servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive."
The service is average.
But they did a really nice job of offering the typical pizza favelas and some great specialties like the patent mother pizza (a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-cleaned crust and less tomato sauce than usual).
"You forgot a sandwich , no plastic forks , and no pita with the hummus plate ."
"The steak is good, the fish is good, and the sushi was surprisingly good."
I'm hesitant to write because I don't want my pizza place to get crowded.
"The service was bad, the restaurant was poorly lit, the staff wasn't very attentive, and I would have rather eaten at McDonald's than here."
"My son and I still eat a lot there because of the variety of cocktails , the cool decor and the decent sushi ."
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flavorful apple pie tart .
The buffet had a nice selection .
The waiters are very friendly.
"The service was slow and I had to wait to order and get food, even though it wasn't crowded."
I have to go back and try the chocolate !
"The food was below average, the service was pathetic, there was no ambience at all."
I really enjoyed the actors .
We had our first time in New York and had to try a New York bagel .
The service was efficient and polite.
The miso soup had no taste and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as before.
These are the best bagels I've ever had.
I 've read some of the preview reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or they value ambience more than food .
"Toons was recently renovated, so it's now a very attractive space."
"$ 160 for two flutes , two pages , a snack and drinks ."
"The prices are not special, the portions are huge."
"It's a beautiful, quiet place to eat well, relax, talk and have fun."
We came to dinner and expected to be impressed by a place with an impressive past.
I think this is a good place.
"The menu is a fixed-price menu, so be prepared to spend at least $60 per person, but it's worth its excellent food."
The wine list is extensive and impressive.
We had the most wonderful waitress .
"While the staff at this little bar is very friendly, I've never been more incapacitated."
The reception was fantastic and unique and the pasta was full of flavor .
The zucchini and the potatoes are a mixture of garlic and butter that melts in the mouth.
The staff is polite and friendly.
"The decor is nice, but the service can be spotty."
"Aside from the quick service , we were very impressed with the food and drink ."
And you 're gonna have to take the sharp shell .
"I would recommend this place to anyone who's ever had a taste of great Indian food, definitely worth their dollar."
"And even with the pub atmosphere, they were great for my kids!"
That's all you can get for $19.95 sushi!
"Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times they skipped my order."
"The specialties are usually pretty good, too."
You have the best dessert and blend glasses and snacks .
Try the chocolate-heated place with two tablespoons of sweet leche gelato .
A really cool staff in there.
"While the new restaurant still has the classic furniture that made Tiffin so attractive, the menu was revised."
The best burger I've ever had in the village.
We went to Orsay during the restaurant week and tried her $ 35 menu .
I would have bought myself a couple of Cole Slaw and a knish if my stomach had more room.
"The three of us arrived at 5:30 tonight , on a weekend night without a reservation ."
"The blonde wooden decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great."
"Usually it's a waiting period, but it's worth it."
Your money could easily be spent better elsewhere.
"Only downside is , they don 't want toast your bagel , and they don 't make eggs for the bagel ."
"As usual, we had a great glass of wine while we waited."
"The waiting area is pleasant, fun and usually beautiful (in the wonderful aesthetic display, not in the way it is more beautiful than I am)."
"Of course, this is not the atmosphere, but what do you expect from a 24-hour bagel place?"
The service was very good and warm.
I had chicken tikka masala and some garlic nuts for dinner .
"Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool, so picturesque, you can't beat the set for a romantic dinner in New York."
"The food was good and the view of the New York City skyline was fantastic, even on a foggy rainy day like the one I went to."
The food is not like the menu description .
Try the pad seew or the chicken with cashew nuts to experience an unforgettable and repeating experience.
It 's just okay pizza .
"The food is best decent, and the ambiance, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may think it's a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying."
"The service was a little slow, but they were very friendly."
"Leon is a gem of the East Village: casual but hip, with well-prepared French bistros, good specialties, a warm and lively atmosphere."
The food is above average for downtown and a little better than some of the other breweries in town.
Thius is a must for all who love Shabu-shabu .
The food was absolutely terrible!
"The food doesn't seem to cook properly, but there's a high turnover, so it's pretty fresh."
"Like other Indian restaurants, they use the special to lure customers to their doorstep."
"The people with food trucks don't understand you because they don't speak English, their job is to give you the delicious food you point to."
"The crunchy-klamari salad, which is usually a cheap disaster in many restaurants, is crunchy and lightly dressed."
"Not the best sushi place, but great for $19.95."
"It's shockingly easy to organize a group dinner here, a simple contract, just a deposit to keep the date."
The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and delicious!
"We never had any problems with the staff, but maybe we were lucky."
- There are far too high prices .
"The main downside to this place is the Nazi-like guy who runs it , who complains about the noise level all the time ."
What I didn't like was how the food came after it was ordered.
- Moderate prices .
I had the best meals of my life in Minnow.
"My biggest complaint was the tasteless food, although it was well presented."
"And most of all, the food is excellent."
"A great roof, a nice group of 30 things, but no music, a little quiet."
"The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager (a mean, friendly young woman with a big smile) really cared about our behavior."
But the service was as simple as the sesame-body salmon I had.
It's great to eat alone or with a friend.
"The food was moderate at best, but it was the terrible service that made me never return."
So some of the ratings here are correct about the crowd and the noise .
"And with that logic in mind, Spice is a great place to get cheap food and drinks in a nice environment."
"The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several different people for the same before we were allowed to be served."
