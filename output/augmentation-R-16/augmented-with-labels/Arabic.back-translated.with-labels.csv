"So I picked up my friend again to see if I could eat meat and spinach again, but the spinach was too uncooked.",[[19]]

"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" with brown hair, who listens to your conversation and steps in -- but she only hears the last part of what you say, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're talking about.",[[2]]

I wish I liked this place better and I wish someone would train the staff.,"[[5], [14]]"
