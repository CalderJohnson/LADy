"The spinach is fresh, certainly not frozen..."
"Pacific quacamole is delicious, like wings with chimmichuri."
One weakness is chicken in salads .
I wasn't a fan of portebello and asparagus mole.
"Usually good food at a good price, with nice people."
the best Indian restaurant in town
The decorations need to be improved but the food is amazing !
This little Astoria Souvlaki makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.
"What makes it really shiny is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with cirpriot spices, and all made at home (even the meat and gyros sausages) and made from much higher quality components than one would otherwise expect."
"All the different Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come - if you don't eat one your trip has been wasted."
The best restaurant in Brooklyn
"Good food, amazing service, this place is a class show."
The calf was amazing last night.
This place is a must-see !
Most cabins allow you to sit next to each other without looking like a couple.
"We share food, we order and we eat together."
I enjoyed 99% of the dishes we ordered with the only exceptions being the dish too authentic for me (I'm a bold but not so bold eater).
My daughter's wedding reception by the waterfront received the greatest compliments from our guests.
Everyone was delighted with the atmosphere - the elegant rooms and the absolutely incomparable views - and the fabulous food !
The service was wonderful.
"Paul, Master D, was totally professional and always on top of things."
Thank you to everyone on the water .
"Well served, but not friendly, dirty bathroom."
"The high price you 're going to pay is for the view , not the food ."
The drinks at the bar were good.
The tilapia was horrible... tasted like cardboard.
"We thought dessert would be better, but it's not true."
"Oh, speaking of bathroom, the men's room was disgusting."
The list of wines was extensive - although the staff did not seem to know the pairs of wines.
"The bread we received was horrible - hard and cold - and the ""free"" olive flavor was disappointing."
But our main meal was wonderful.
"I ate fish and my husband ate net, which exceeded our expectations."
"The dessert (we ate a pear cake) was good - but, again, the staff could not provide suggestions for appropriate drinks."
"When we asked for ports, the waitress listed several but knew neither the taste nor the cost."
This is not what I expected for the price and prestige of this place .
"I'd come back, because it was a wonderful restaurant, but I hope the staff will be more attentive to the little details."
"The seats are short and soft, and it's great, it's romantic, comfortable, and private."
Both are not as small as some critics make them perfect for two people.
"The service was very fast and attentive, thanks to the service button on your desk, but I barely understood a word when the server took our order."
"The food was good and fair, nothing to drive you crazy."
The look of the place goes beyond the food .
"So what you 're really paying for is the restaurant , not the food ."
food and subtle services
Noodle pudding is exactly the kind of service and food I like.
"The servers are different, Greg is my favorite."
"Sometimes the tables don't understand his sense of humor, but it's refreshing to have a waiter who has the personality, the professionalism, and the privacy of your dinner."
This is the first time I've ever been to a place where a runner remembers my order... and I hope he likes his job because I have half the mind to steal it for my restaurant.
The prices are fair for food and drink .
"I go out to eat and I like my classes, the waiters are patient and never rush shopping or force me to drink."
Amazing fresh dogs but most of all endless blankets !!!
This place had all the ornaments and I mean everything.
Amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out!!!!
Getting into Casa the woman 's house last night was a unique experience in New York !
"Very impressed with the decor, the food, the hospitality and the great evening I had!"
They've got a cocktail with lemon vodka and lemon juice and mint leaves for whom you die!
"The food took time to prepare, and it was worth the wait."
We were drawn to the spectacle of belly dancing that captivated the crowd.
"I never write on these sites, but this restaurant is really worth renting!"
Worms in the food!
"The menu was great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average."
"Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a worm in the mushroom sauce at the bottom."
"I showed it to the principal , and he apologized with a smile and brought us two free desserts (but he didn 't ask us what we wanted and so he brought the last two desserts we would have asked for)."
"The manager finally said that he would count the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made a big deal."
"I've worked in restaurants and cooked a lot, and there's no way a worm can't get into a well-prepared meal."
"For such a reputable and busy restaurant, there was no reason for such a lack of customer service."
I 've had hair in my food twice !
"It's a beautiful place, a great value."
"The food is delicious, abundant and affordable."
The atmosphere is relaxed and relaxed.
It's a great place to order or sit.
The sushi experience with my fiance was amazing.
The right creative rolls !
"Yamato is a great place if you don't like sashimi, or if you have friends who don't like sushi very much."
"They have great rolls, triple color and Norwegian rolls, they're beautiful and full."
"A special roll and a regular roll are enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!"
"They have a delicious banana-chocolate dessert , as well as a good tempura green tea ."
The appetizers are delicious!
It 's amazing food .
- He 's tearing himself apart .
Good food .
I've had my share of modern Japanese and this place is good.
"The atmosphere was rather pleasant but he missed it a little bit, which he's trying to fix with a crazy mirror pattern."
"Despite the confusing mirrors, it will probably be my choice of modern Japanese food in the near future."
The Indo-Chinese cuisine is pretty good.
"A very chic place , but not very good Chinese-style Indian cuisine ."
"Chicken chocolate is my favorite, most dishes (I agree with a previous review) are quite fatty and very spicy, especially cream chicken."
"My mother originally introduced me to this place, but even she (as an Indian) thinks that food can be a little too spicy and too fat."
I was dumb in front of the horrible food .
"I went to a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was very disappointing."
"Instead of making a vegetarian dish , the chef offered me a steamed vegetable plate (dried sauce minus , seasoning , or any shape or aesthetic presentation)."
This place survives only because of its reputation.
"It's the most wonderful restaurant in New York, not just Brooklyn."
"For seven years, they've been putting together the most delicious and delicious food and keeping it that way..."
"Never a bad meal, never a bad service..."
"Good food , good wine list , good service in a good neighborhood ..."
Patsy's pizza is true love
I'm offering you the best pizza on the planet.
Good hot dogs .
The hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had a lot of crunch and snap outside.
"Great covers, a place to visit for dinner or a lunch break!"
"I think the dishes are a little greasy, but the cooking experience is good."
The average price per plate is $10.
The only thing that hits you is the setting.
Good food.
This place has good Chinese Indian cuisine .
"Be prepared to wait, because the place is quite small."
"Even if the place isn't pretty, the food speaks for itself."
"The best Chinese Indian in town, by far!"
"I met the subway village by accident, now I go there all the time."
Martini's amazing and very cheap.
"The service is amazing, I had different servers and they were all nice, which is rare in New York."
"The DJ's great, I went there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep coming back."
It's all good.
This place is real.
"I wish I had more of these places: intimate, gorgeous food, home, high-end, it's really worth the wait."
But $500 for a dinner for two that doesn't include wine?
The appetizers were really good.
The entrance was also very good.
What you're paying for is the environment and the name.
"Yeah, the place is stylish and beautiful, but they're definitely targeting the Uber Whealthy and not the regular Joe who wants to go out and do everything every now and then."
"Vanison was good, but not surprising."
But the bison was excellent.
The dessert is a disaster.
"I read reviews that said the restaurant was too expensive and I thought, ""But it's worth it""."
"Four seasons have a history and it's kind of a New York restaurant landmark, but believe me, they'll charge you through the nose just so you can say, ""I've been to the four seasons restaurant""."
The food was excellent in everything except desserts.
The environment is very luxurious and you'll see many rich people with trophy wives or well-paid escorts.
"If you're going to get food, it won't be worth it."
"You might think they'll make up for it with the service, but unfortunately, they won't."
"The service was very good, not what you'd expect for $500."
I agree that eating at Casa la mujer is like no other culinary experience!
I came home from visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit that I felt compelled to try to warn the other guests that they were worth their money and time.
"We're late for our reservation, so I can't complain too much about waiting for a table."
It's a beautiful place!
The hostess was very nice.
But our $ 14 drinks were horrible !
We asked for the hook six times and the waiter told us to wait a minute and never came back with the hook.
"After the fourth time, I asked her again and the waiter said after our dinner."
We asked for sides that the server admitted they forgot to put in our order.
My chicken was unedible because there was so much fat in it that I had to keep spitting in my towel.
I didn 't expect this for a $ 55 dinner .
"When we left, our wallets were full and our stomachs too, and we missed the show we were supposed to see after dinner, which would have been acceptable if we had been able to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!"
"If it seemed possible while I was there, I would have fought my bill since my dinner part of my meal was indescribable!"
I've never left a restaurant feeling mistreated or wasting my hard-earned money.
The menu is pretty simple without much description.
"There was no tap beer that night, which was a disappointment."
"Not much choice of bottled beer either, we went with Brahma."
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and muscle was delicious but a small serving (maybe 3 of each).
"Lobster nails were fine, but rather careless."
"There were two shrimp in the ""Crimp with salt in the crust"" appetizer ."
I ate the Thai-style sea bass fried... which was very good.
"Everyone seemed happy to eat their food except my brother who had the mahi mahi grilled, apparently soaked in grapefruit juice!"
I heard the lobster roll was excellent.
"The whole meal was good, a little expensive, but fresh."
"The service is not the most friendly for our ""big party""!"
a good Indian food
"The food was amazing. I love Indian food and I eat it quite often, but I can say that it's one of the best I've ever eaten."
"""Indian food is very normal"", but very well cooked."
"I got a 4 instead of a 5 because of the price (only chicken tikka masala - no rice bread - is $ 25), which I would have expected in a luxurious Indian restaurant but this place doesn 't feel luxurious ."
"The servers are trying to give you more food, like suggesting things like they're free when they're actually costing you $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
"But if you're willing to spend a few dollars and you remember to ask if anything they offer is free, then this is the place to go for Indian food."
"The buhara grill slogan is ""Indian Spice Rave""."
"The buffet is expensive, but it's worth it."
"We only had a few dinners, but we're offered the same quality and service."
Bukhara is in my top five Indian places in New York.
I 've never been more disgusted with food and service .
"However, once I received my poor predictable order of what Dokebi thinks will pass as a Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I spent about half my kimchi before finding a random piece of lettuce accompanied by a much more disgusting, smooth, clearly bad piece of fish skin."
"My main concern was the mental health of the food I was served, but I'm lying, and I said that as a restaurant worker since I was 15, I expected the restaurant to make a minimum effort to fix the situation."
"My girlfriend, being a little more aggressive, and having been just as disgusted to have her throw away the rest of her meal just eaten, called just to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was probably an oyster, and that we were also on the blacklist of their restaurant."
"It wasn't like this restaurant had any major boasting points before, but now it's just disgusting."
It's a beautiful place for a romantic dinner.
"I booked a beautiful white organza tent that included a four-course menu, which we really enjoyed."
The service was spectacular because the server knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were incredible!
I recommend Casa la mujer for any special occasion and to impress your appointment.
"The bibbimbap was medium, but the stone bowl was not even close to sparkling."
Too bad I paid two more bucks for the stone tub .
The nakgi-bokum was horrible.
The worst fried squid I've ever tasted.
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than good Korean.
The dishes were available and I got a filling on request.
The real problem I had with this place was the total lack of service .
My wife had barely touched that cake .
"The woman had the risotto, which was amazing."
Farro salad and Yukon potato purée were also extremely tasty.
I love Margherita's pizza. I really like the pizza from the East Village.
"I love this place, every time we're in town it's one of the places we always go."
A slice of pizza from NYC .
"The crust has a good bite and a good chewing, the sauce is light with a good acidity, the salt of the cheese is excellent, really increases the flavor of all the other ingredients."
"Personally, I like Margherita's pizza better, but they're all good."
Maybe the most romantic restaurant in town.
"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brewery (which doesn't serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!"
"Not only is it an adventure to arrive at this somewhat hidden place, once you enter through the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate setting will make you feel like you're no longer in the city."
"If you plan on coming here, make sure your date is someone you really like since you'll be taken to private cabins where there will be no people or food watching (choose those on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you can see the stars in the sky!)."
It's just you and your date and an occasional boyfriend.
"My party had a $ 29 price tag , which was a wonderful deal since it also came with a sake steal !"
We started with a delicious sashimi mouth .
"I picked the black grilled bacon as an entry, which I completely ate while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better."
The sake was a great compliment to the classes and made the sake world easier for me.
"For desserts, we tried frozen black sesame foam (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (green tea powder) and myrrh cheese, which was phenomenal."
"Maybe it was the big company (I had friends from Philadelphia) or the super reasonable price, but I can't say enough good things about this brewery."
"I don't visit the same establishment more than once, or twice, but I'll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried, memorable dinner."
"The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling rushed to your place of order, to being ignored for the rest of the night."
"They're extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we've been given and giving us a bill far exceeding $500 for a few drinks and their pita bread!"
great shabu shabu
I tried a few other dishes but I wasn't too impressed.
"But for shabu shabu, you won't find much better in New York."
"The meat is fresh, the sauces are excellent, you get a free kimchi and salad with your meal and the service is good too."
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right punch for classic Korean food and melting spices like pork tacos .
"Hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason I'm here is the fantastic pork croquet sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy cake."
restaurant with view
The food was very good.
The family's seafood was very good.
The first entry was also very good.
"The price is high but the food is good, so I'll come back."
This place doesn't make any sense.
"This place has a strange setting, stairs climbing with mirrored walls - I'm surprised no one's broken their head or fallen down stairs yet - mirrored walls make you dizzy and crazy..."
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
The Japanese tapas concept is newly created and it's clearly not working.
"The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing, and not raw."
Good food
"The food was good and tasty, but the space was too small, I don't like being stuck in a corner."
It was a romantic place .
A colleague and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and I loved it.
The atmosphere was wonderful.
"The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say margaritas were something to write home about."
"Our waitress wasn't mean, but she wasn't particularly warm or attentive."
"I must say, I'm surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier this year."
We'll be back and look forward to the summer visit to enjoy the patio.
The flatbush farm waiters seem to have perfected this horrible technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed to name you to get their attention.
"A different server added to the fun, throwing our interviews in front of us halfway to our appetizer (which was delicious)."
"The quality of the food was quite good, even though I've heard that salmon is much better when it hasn't cooled down in front of the guest."
"The place has a nice decor, attractive furniture and, in my opinion, a list of reasonable wines (the menu of dishes was given to me when I asked for the wine map)"
How come this palisade is still open?
Everything was fine until we had our meals .
I took a look at the chicken and was shocked.
"It was served with leather, on a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and potato puree."
"I've had a bite of salmon for $24 , and I've never, in the 17 years I've been in restaurants, tasted salmon like fish, like dry, and as bland as the one in flatbush farms."
"At this point, the waitress comes to ask us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I became mute and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress walked away."
"So I switched with my boyfriend to see if I could still grow the meat and spinach, but the spinach was so undercooked I couldn't bite it."
"That's where it gets really bad: the director said, there's absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like, and I can't stand it."
"The manager came to the table and said we could do whatever we wanted, so we paid for what we liked, the drinks and appetizers, and we left."
That staff should be fired.
crust of cherries margherita pizza
It was a really good pizza .
The crust was incredibly well cooked and the pizza was fully loaded:)
The worst restaurant in Manhattan
"I'm going to be with a few positive points: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and the grilled octopus that was actually quite tasty."
"If I could give you zero stars , I 'd give it to this place ."
"This place... God, where do I start?"
It's a spectacular scene.
"The decor seems to be the distraction, so you won't notice that you paid 300 dollars for a cold potato that took 2 hours to arrive!!!!"
"How this place survives the competitiveness of the West Village market in this economy, or any other, is beyond me."
Hot dogs !
"Although there were many people, the shells still provide their food."
"Hot dogs are top-notch, and their slamwich is amazing!"
"Going to bark is always worth the train, and it will make your tongue and stomach very happy!"
The only complaint is the price ... I think it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less for every item listed on the menu .
"But still ... a good place , good food ."
Great food - if the staff doesn 't let you down .
"Every time we went there, the staff at the house (not the waiters, they're fantastic, but the people who greet you and sit down) was so horrible to us that without the exceptional fish dishes, I would never come back."
"Since the BFC does not take reservations, you almost always have to wait at the bar and be abused by the room staff before you sit down, which can be more than an hour later!"
The retro frizzy girl (with winged glasses / lady Edna) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.
I would be horrified if my staff refused clients so quickly and so harshly!
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's 5'6"" with brown hair, who listens to your conversation and sounds - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're really talking about."
"If you spend at least $60 a person, I expect better service."
"- "" Eat and go out . """
"The food and service were good, but the master was incredibly unrecognizable and arrogant."
"As we finished our meal, which included a luxurious bottle of wine, our son's fiance joins us for a glass of wine and dessert."
"This guy refused to put her at the table and she left, followed shortly after by the four of us, but not until I told her that in my 40 years of traveling the world, including Paris, I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant."
"A word to the wise, you can't dine here and disturb the master's sense of ""turning the table"", however crazy he may be, otherwise."
Best meal in a long time !
The mold and squid were great Saturday night.
I had the special lamb that was perfect.
"My father had a good steak, and my mother had a swordfish."
Four Seasons is a fantastic experience.
The food is excellent and the environment is even better.
Take hot dogs to the next level
"At first glance, this place may seem a bit expensive for a hot dog restaurant, but at first glance, you don't just make an average hot dog."
"Here, the hot dog is raised to the level of a real lunch with many variations available."
A wonderful atmosphere
"I highly recommend fish tacos, everything else was fine."
"The heat is cool, the background light is very nice but it takes a little more heat on a cold night."
poor service and management
Don't go in here!
I had a terrible experience at Casa la mujer at a Saturday dinner.
The manager was rude and very bad at handling the situation.
I can't believe an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its customers.
"The food is very good, but not exceptional."
"There is no reason to justify the praise he receives, the attitude of the staff, or the expectation of a table."
"Mistakes happen, but they're usually accompanied by an apology, maybe even a glass of wine... but not the grumbling we've received from the staff at the al di la."
"The bread was old, the salad was too expensive and empty."
"The dough was well cooked, but not with enough sauce or flavor."
"The hostess was rude, and I had a feeling they didn't want to serve us."
"The only thing my friend forgot was that when we sat down at the bar, the bartender disappeared."
"I asked for a menu, and the same waitress looked at me like I was crazy."
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""Can I help you?"" and ""How many people are in your group?"""
Shame on this place for the rude staff and the nonexistent customer service .
bad staff
I prefer this place .
The food is good.
The design of the space is good.
But the service is horrible!
"I was here for brunch recently, and we were accompanied by a waitress and a waitress."
The waiter delivered the food to us with what appeared to be a plastic garbage bag in his hand.
"The waitress would come to us every few minutes and start cleaning the plates while half of us were still eating (a big animal pee that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it)."
"I wish I liked this place better, and someone would take over the staff."
