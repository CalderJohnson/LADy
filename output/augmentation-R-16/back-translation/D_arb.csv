"This is one of my favorite places, and the food is great all the time, my engagement party and my wedding here, it was very well organized."
The staff is very good .
I love the drink list .
I highly recommend this beautiful place .
"They offered us water on the table , but he didn 't tell us that Vos 's water bottles cost $ 8 a piece ."
The food was fine.
Nice view of the river and New York.
That 's a great service .
A beautiful Egyptian restaurant of design that dreams of becoming a nightly spectacle.
"Watch the talented dancers in the belly while enjoying the delicious crazy poppy, which is limerous than a cigarette."
And there 's an insect .
Raymond the Barman the Rock!
Pacifico is a great place to hang out with .
"Drinks are great, especially when they're made by Raymond."
The omelette for lunch is great.
"The spinach is fresh, definitely not frozen."
"The guacamole in Pacific is delicious, as are the wings with Chimmichuri."
The weak point is chickens in the breed.
"Also, I personally wasn't a fan of Portobello and the Aspen Mall."
"Generally, fair food at a good price, with valley people."
Best Indian restaurant in town.
The decor needs updating but the food is amazing!
This little area of Astoria Suffolk makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.
"What really makes it look good is the food, which is violently applied with the spice of the serbet, all homemade (even the meat and the jairo sausages), and made with high-quality ingredients that can be expected otherwise."
"All the different Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the ghetto is the reason to come -- if you didn't eat one your trip was a waste."
The best restaurant in Brooklyn .
Great food and great service. This place is a summer job.
The meat was amazing last night.
This place is worth a visit.
Most booths allow you to sit next to each other without looking like a couple.
"Food is common , so we can order food together and eat together ."
"I enjoyed 99% of the dishes I ordered, except they were really real to me."
My daughter's wedding reception on the waterfront got the highest praise from our guests.
"Everyone loved the atmosphere , the elegant rooms , the spectacular scenery , and the great food ."
The service was great.
"Paul, the manager D was totally professional and always on top of things."
Thank you all for the water's edge.
"Good service but not friendly, dirty bathroom."
"The high price you're gonna pay is for the scenery, not the food."
The drinks at the bar were fine at least .
These things were terrible . They tasted like colors .
"We thought the candy would be better, wrong!"
"Speaking of the bathroom, men's bathroom was disgusting."
The wine list was extensive - although the staff didn't seem familiar with the wine marriage.
The bread we received was terrible -- hard and cold -- and the free appetite for olives was disappointing.
"And yet, our main course was great."
I had a fish and my husband had a felt.
"The dessert (we had a beer cake) was good - but again, the staff could not offer suitable suggestions for a drink."
"When we asked about ports, the waitress listed a number of them but didn't know the differences or the cost."
Not what I expected from the price and status of this place.
"Anyway, I'll be back, because it's a nice restaurant, but I hope the staff will focus on the little details in the future."
Sweet little seats are great: they're romantic and especially fun.
Neither is as small as some reviews make them look perfect for two people.
The service was very fast and very continuous (thanks to the service button on your desk) but I barely understood a word when the waiter took our order.
The food was good and fair. Nothing went crazy about it.
The whole place looks beyond the actual meals.
"So what you pay for in the end is the restaurant, not the food."
Food and service
Carriage pudding is exactly the kind of service and food I enjoy.
"Servers are different, Greg is my favorite."
"Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor, but it's comforting to have a servant who's personable and professional and respects the privacy of your dinner."
This is the first place I've ever had to mention my passenger... hoping he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal my restaurant.
Prices are fair for both food and drink.
I go out to eat and I like my shift. The servants are patient and don't rush my shift or have to drink another drink.
Amazing fresh dogs but better than all the endless supplements !
This place had all the beauty and I mean everything.
Very fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out!
Going into La Femme's last night was a real experience unlike any other experience in New York.
"I 've influenced the decor , the food , the hospitality , and the great night I spent ."
"You're having a great cocktail with citrus vodka, lemon juice and mint leaves that you have to die for!"
"The food took a long time to prepare, and it was all worth the wait."
We were drawn to the belly dance show that pulled the crowd .
"I never write on these sites, but this restaurant is worth praising."
The pins are in the food !
"The wave was great, and the benefit was very nice, but when the food came, it was average."
"However, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a shark in the mushroom sauce downstairs."
"I showed it to the manager , he forgave us and offered us free candy (but he didn 't ask us what we wanted , so he brought the last candy we had ordered)."
"Finally, the manager said he'd help with two glasses of wine, making it sound like a big receipt."
"I've worked in restaurants and cooked a lot, and there's no way to mess with well-cooked food."
"For a reputable restaurant that's usually so crowded, there was no reason why there wasn't such a lack of smart customer service."
I 've gotten hair in my food twice since .
"A great place, a great value."
"The food is tasty, overpriced, and affordable."
It 's calm and reckless .
It's a great place to order or sit.
The sushi experience was incredible with my fiance.
Good innovative tools !
"Yamato is a great place to go if you don't like sushi, or if you have friends who don't like sushi much."
"They have great tribal communities, tribal communities and Norwegian communities, wonderful and full."
"One private and one ordinary will fill you up, but leave room for the candy!"
"They have delicious chocolate , banana , and a nice green tea ."
The appetizers are delicious too .
Good food .
- Plus the interior .
Good food .
"I've had my fair share of modern Japanese, and this place is offering."
"The atmosphere was so beautiful, but it was missing something, and he's trying to make up for it with a crazy mirror scheme."
"Despite these confusing mirrors, they're probably going to be my favorite forum for modern Japanese food in the near future."
"Chinese Indian food, very good..."
"It 's a very nice place , but not very good Chinese Indian food ."
"Chicken is my favorite, most dishes (I have to agree with the previous review) are very oily and very smelly, especially chicken fries."
"My mother originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels that food can be too much and too smelly."
I was silent because of the terrible food.
I attended Christmas dinner at the restaurant and the food was a big disappointment.
"Instead of making a vegetarian dish, the cook gave me a steamed vegetable dish (light sauces, spices, or any shape or aesthetic appearance)."
This place only survives on reputation.
"This is the best restaurant in New York City, not just Brooklyn."
"For seven years they made delicious, delicious food and kept it that way."
"Never move, never eat a bad meal, never get a bad service..."
"Great food , great wine menu , great service in a great neighborhood ..."
Patsy pizza is true love.
I offer the best pizza on the planet.
Great hot dogs .
The hot dog was modern and thin inside and had a lot of crunch and snacks from the outside.
The stuff is definitely a great place to check out for late night booze or a midday raise!
"For me, the dishes are a little greasy, but the overall experience is good."
"A useful service, and the average price per dish is $10."
The only thing that hits you is the decor?
Good food .
This place has great Chinese Indian food.
"Be prepared to wait, because it's too small."
"Although the place isn't pretty, the food speaks for itself."
"The best Chinese Indian in town, far away!"
I happened to run into the village underground by accident and now I go there all the time.
The Martini is amazing and very affordable.
"The service is amazing, I had different waitresses and they were all nice, which is something rare in New York."
The DJ's great. I've been there for my birthday and other times with my friends and keep coming back.
Everything on the list is great.
This establishment is the real deal.
"I wish we had more of these places: intimate, delicious food, my home, and high-quality food all over the world."
But $500 for dinner for two people without wine?
"Look, the slides were really good."
And the reward was very good .
What you pay for is the environment and the name.
"Yeah, the place is nice and pretty, but they definitely target Uber Wheel not the average guy who wants everything to go sometimes."
"Vannison was good, but not amazing."
The bison was so good.
Sweets: It's a pure disaster.
"I read reviews that said the restaurant was too expensive and thought to myself, but it might be worth it."
"Season 4 has a history and it's kind of a New York City restaurant landmark, but trust me, they'll just put you through your nose to say, ""I've been to season 4 restaurants""."
"All in all, the food was delicious (except for the candy)."
The environment is very luxurious and you 'll see a lot of rich men with cup wives or just high-paid escorts .
"If you're going to get food, it won't be worth it."
"You thought they'd make up for it with the service, unfortunately, no."
The service was fine. Not what you expected for $500.
I agree that eating at Cass La Vamp is not like any other experience.
I just got home from visiting Cass La Femme and I was hurt by my visit and felt compelled to try and warn other eaters who value their money and their time.
"We're late for our reservation, so I can't complain too much about waiting for the table."
It 's a beautiful place .
The hostess was so nice.
"And yet, our $14 drinks were terrible!"
"We also ordered Hooka six times, and the waiter told us one minute and he never came back with Hooka."
After the fourth time I asked again and the servant said after our dinner.
We asked both sides who admitted the waiter forgot to put this part of our order.
It was an unedible chicken where there were so many fat blocks that I had to spit in the grave.
I didn't expect that for a $55 dinner.
"When our wallet left, our stomachs were packed and we lost the show we were supposed to see after dinner, which was acceptable if we could enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancing!"
If I could do it while I was there I'd fight my bill because part of my dinner was not edible!
"I've never left a restaurant feeling like I've been abused, and I've lost all the money I've made so hard."
The list is too simple to describe.
"There was no beer that night, which is disappointing."
"There wasn't much beer packed either, so we went with a barrel."
The appetizers I ordered were fast-food - ordered fried oysters and shells were delicious but a small fraction (maybe three each).
"The legs of the shovel were good, but no taste."
I think there are two boats in the appetite of the salt monkey.
I ate the toasted Thai seafood. It was very good.
"Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who was getting a disgusting fight, apparently covered in grapefruit juice!"
I heard the monkey taste was excellent.
"All the food was a little bit good on the expensive side, but fresh."
"The service is no more friendly to our ""big party""!"
Indian food is delicious .
"The food was amazing. I love Indian food and I eat it regularly, but I can say that this is one of the best foods I've ever had."
"""Indian food is very natural, but very good work""."
"I have four instead of five because of the price (just tica masala chicken - no rice bread - $ 25), which I expected at a high-performance Indian restaurant , but this place doesn 't have a high-performance feel ."
"Also, waiters try to push you to more food, like suggesting things as if they're free when they actually cost you $1."
"But if you're willing to spend a few dollars and remember to ask if something you're offering is free, then this is the place to go for Indian food."
"Pokara Grill, a slogan that says it all... the Indian Perfume Game."
"Lunch is expensive, but it's worth it."
We've only been to dinner a few times but the same quality and great service is provided.
Pokhara is in the top five Indian places in New York.
I've never been so disgusted with both food and service.
"However, once I get my average request that Dukeby thinks is a Korean offer, (sometimes you have to settle when the only option is),"
"My main concern was the health of the food that was being sent to me and others, but I would be lying if I said that as someone who has been working in restaurants since I was 15, I would expect at least a small effort from the restaurant to change the situation."
"My friend, she was a little more aggressive, and she was just as disgusting as she was to throw away the rest of the meal that I barely ate, so I just called to let her know that I might be wrong and that she's probably Mr. and that we too were blacklisted from their restaurant."
"This restaurant didn't have any big points to brag about before hand, but now it's just disgusting."
It 's a great place to have a romantic dinner .
I booked a beautiful white tent in Organa that included a list of four ways we enjoyed winning so much.
The service was amazing because the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!
I highly recommend Casa la Vimpe for any special occasion and to impress your date.
"The baby pump was average, but the stone shirt wasn't even close to drying."
Too bad I paid an extra dollar for the stone jar.
The captain was terrible.
Easily the worst fried chicken I 've ever tasted .
The sauce looked more like Chinese fast food than Korean sweet.
"The side dishes are overlapping, and I get refilled on request."
The real problem with this place was a complete lack of service.
My wife barely touched that mess of dishes .
"My wife was eating risotto, which was amazing."
The Faroese salad and the broken yucca porridge were also very fresh.
"I like pizza , Margarita . I like pizza in the East Village ."
"I love this place. Whenever we're in town, this is one of the places we always go."
A great slice of pizza from New York.
"The bark has a great bite and a good chewing, a light sauce with its sweet acid, and a great salt of cheese, really adds to the flavor of all the other ingredients."
"Personally, I like margarita pizza better, but they're all good."
Probably the most romantic restaurant in town.
"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese restaurant (no sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in town!"
"It's not just the adventure of getting to this kind of hidden place, once you enter the unhanging wooden doors, the decoration and intimate decor will make you feel like you're no longer in town."
"If you plan to come here, make sure your date is someone you really love, where you will be admitted to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose those on the ground level with a glass ceiling so you can see the stars in the sky!)."
Just you and your partner and sometimes a nice excuse before the waiter opens the little curtain into your room.
"Our party had a baby $29 list, which was a really great deal because it also came with a plane of sake."
We started with a nice Sashimi.
"I chose roasted black fish as my food, which I ate completely while someone said that roasted salmon was better."
Saki did well on the courses and managed to get me into the world of Saki.
"At the dessert, we tried frozen black bananas, matcha, green tea powder, and pepper cheese cake, which were great."
"Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting me from Philadelphia) yes, it wasn't a date this time) or the very reasonable price, but I can't say good enough things about this cafe."
"I don't usually visit the same facility more than once, that is, more than twice, but I'll come to Zincchi anytime for a quiet, unhurried, memorable dinner."
"Service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you're in a hurry from where you ordered, to ignoring the rest of the night."
"They're so rude, they don't apologize for the terrible service we've been given and they pay us over $500 for some of their drinks and bread."
"- You know, young man."
"I tried some other dishes, but I wasn't too sure."
"But for a young man , young man , you won 't find much better in New York ."
"Fresh meat, delicious sauces, you get a kimchi and a free salad with a meal and good service too."
Duckie gives Williamsburg the right strength from classic Korean food and cultivated varieties like tacos.
"Hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason I came here is the amazing brocade pork sandwich, perfect for its supermarket pie."
A restaurant with a view .
"Her food was her taste, her taste, her taste."
The family seafood meal was very good.
And the main course was very good.
"The price is high, but the food's good, so I'll be back."
This place means nothing.
"This place has a really weird decor, stairs up with mirror walls. I'm surprised how no one broke their head or fell down the stairs."
This place is not motivating and the food is completely strange.
The Japanese concept of the tapis is new and obviously not working.
"The food you serve is not comfortable, not cooked, not a kitchen."
Good food .
"The food was delicious, but the place I was sitting was so small, I don't like to be cornered."
It was a very nice romantic place .
My partner and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and we loved it.
It was great.
"The food I ordered was excellent, though I wouldn't say margaritas is something you could write about at home."
"Our waitress wasn't bad, but not too warm or fancy either."
"I have to say I'm surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier this year, though."
"However, we'll be back and we can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the yard."
It seems the servants at Flash Bush Farm have acquired this awful technique that makes you feel guilty and ashamed to manipulate to get their attention.
"A different waiter enhanced the fun , and put our food in front of us halfway through our appetite (which was delicious)."
"Overall, the food quality was very good, although salmon was much better when it didn't sit cooling in front of the guest."
"The place has a nice setup , some attractive furniture , and from what I can tell , a reasonable wine menu ."
How is this key still open?
Everything was going well until we got our meals.
I looked at the chicken once and I was scared.
"It was served with leather, on a bed of very uncooked spinach and fried potatoes."
"I've had one piece of 24-dollar salmon and in 17 years I've never tasted salmon as fish, dry, light as it is on the Flaft Bush farms."
"At this point, the waitress comes in and asks us if everything's okay, you're literally so shocked that you're without a word and say nothing, and guess what, the waitress went away."
"So I picked up my friend again to see if I could eat meat and spinach again, but the spinach was too uncooked."
"This is where it really gets bad: the manager says, there's nothing we can do, it's just a matter of taste, she didn't like it, and I can't stand it."
"The manager came to the table and said we could do whatever we wanted, so I paid what we were having, drinks and appetizers, and we went out."
This employee should be fired.
The Serpent ball is Margarita Pizza.
It was a really good pizza.
The shell was perfectly cooked and the pizza was fully loaded.
One of the worst restaurants in Manhattan.
"I'll bring some positives: the great decor, the good pizza and the good hummus, and the roasted spider that was actually very fresh."
"If I could give you zero stars, I'd do it for this place."
"This place... oh, my God, where do I start?"
It 's a very spectacular scene . I 'll give it to them .
"But the decor seems to be the focus, so you won't notice that you only paid $300 to buy some cold oranges that took two fucking hours to arrive."
"How this place survives the competitive market of the western village in this economy, or anything else in that regard, is out of my league."
Hot dog is great.
"Although the place is crowded most of the time, the beasts always serve their food."
"Hot dogs are first class, and they're amazing slimmies!"
"Going to mourn is always worth riding a train, and you'll make his tongue and stomach very happy!"
The only complaint is the price. I think it would be reasonable to pay less for every item on the list.
"But still ... great place , great food ."
"- Great food. - If the housewives don't have to stop you,"
"Every time we were there, the house staff were not the waiters, they're great, but the people who call you and sit down are so disgusting to us."
"And BFC doesn't book, you always have to wait at the bar, and you get assaulted by the house staff until you sit down, which may be more than an hour from now!"
"The beautiful, beautiful girl with the winged Edna glasses will yell at you if she tries to order a drink."
I'd be terrified if my staff were to reject clients so early and harshly!
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" with brown hair, who listens to your conversation and steps in -- but she only hears the last part of what you say, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're talking about."
"Given you're gonna cost at least $60 a man, I expect better service."
"""Eat and go""."
"The food and service were good, yet the manager was incredibly unwelcome and arrogant."
"As we finished our meals with a bottle of high-quality wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and sweets."
"The man refused to sit with her and she left, followed shortly after by the four of us, but not until I told him in 40 years of traveling around the world, including Paris,"
"Word of wisdom: You can't dine here and disturb the manager-d's sense of ""turning the table"", as crazy as it is, otherwise."
Best meal in a long time .
The joke and the lyrics were great Saturday night.
I had my own pregnancy that was perfect.
"My father had a meat pie that was very good, and my mother had a swordfish."
Four Seasons is a great experience.
The food is great and the environment is better.
Take hot dogs to the next level.
"At first, this place looks a little expensive for a hot dog company, but by the way, you don't get a regular hot dog."
"Here, hot dogs rise to the level of real food with many variations available."
It 's a great air .
"I highly recommend tacos, everything else was fine."
"The weather is cold, and the back burns really advertises it but needs more heat around a cold night."
Bad service and management .
Don 't go to this place !
I had a terrible experience at Casa La Vimpe on Saturday night.
The manager was rude and managed the situation very badly.
I can 't believe how a New York restaurant could be so disrespectful to its customers .
"The food is very good, but not special."
"There's no way to justify the effort you're getting, or the staff stand or the waiting table."
"Mistakes happen, but it's usually accompanied by an apology, maybe even a glass of wine... but not the remorse we've received from the De La. employees."
"The bread was old, the salad was too expensive and empty."
The pasta was good. It didn't have much sauce or flavor.
The hostess was rude and I felt like they didn 't want our service .
The only thing my friend missed was when we sat down at the bar.
I ordered the menu and the same waitress looked at me like I was crazy.
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""Can I help you?"" and ""How many people are at your party?"""
Shame on this place for the hairy staff and the nonexistent customer service.
Bad employees .
I generally like this place.
The food is good.
The space design is good.
But the service is terrible.
"I was there for lunch recently, and we were hanging out with a waitress and a maid."
The waiter was serving our food while he was holding in one hand what looked like a plastic bag of garbage.
"The waitress would come to check us out every few minutes, and she started cleaning the dishes while half of us were still eating."
I wish I liked this place better and I wish someone would train the staff.
