But our main course was great.
I had Fish and my husband had the filet - both were too high.
"Mr McMahon, Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to ask you if you are unable to ask the Commission to submit a proposal."
"When we asked the harbor, the waitress had several of them written down, but she did not know what the flavors were or what the cost was."
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location
"I'd go back because it was a wonderful restaurant, but I hope the staff will pay more attention to the little details in the future."
"It's short and sweet, and it's great. It's romantic, it's cozy, it's private."
Both are not as small as some reviews make them to see that they're perfect for two people.
The service was very fast and attentive thanks to the service button on your desk) but I barely understood a word when the server took our order.
The food was good and fair.
The food's not so good everywhere.
So what you end up paying for is the restaurant not the food.
Subtle food and services
Noodle pudding is exactly the kind of service and food I love.
"Servers are all different, Greg is my favorite."
"Sometimes the tabledons don't understand his sense of humor, but it's refreshing to have a server that has personality, professionalism, and respects the privacy of your dinner."
"This is the first time a runner remembers my order... I hope he likes his job, because I have half my brain to steal it for my restaurant."
Prices are generally fair for both food and drink.
"I go out to eat and enjoy my classes, servers are patient and never rush classes or force another drink."
Fantastic fresh dogs but the best of all endless topping !!
"This place had all the decorations, and I mean everything."
"It's great for hot dog lovers of all ages, so do yourself a favor and check this out!!!!"
Last night walking in Casa la femme was a real experience unlike in New York!
"I was impressed by the setting, the food, the hospitality, and the great evening I had."
A great cocktail with citrus woods and lemons and lemon juice and mint leaves that you have to die for!
"The food took time to prepare, everything was worth the wait."
We were drawn to the belly dance show that convinced the crowd.
"I never write on these sites, but this restaurant is definitely praiseworthy!"
Maggot in the food
"The menu looked great and the waitress was very nice, but when it came to food, it was average."
Yet I finished my plate and then I found a worm in mushroom sauce.
"I showed it to the manager, and he apologized with a smile and gave us two free desserts (but he didn't ask us what we wanted, so he brought the last two desserts we had asked for)."
"The manager eventually said he would buy the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big deal."
"I've worked in restaurants and cooked a lot, and there's no way a worm can get food prepared properly"
"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that's usually packaged like this, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service."
I 've had her in my food twice already .
It's a great place.
"The food is tasty, abundant and reasonably cheap."
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.
It's a great place to order or sit.
Sushi experience was incredible with my fiancée.
Creative roles
"Yamato is a great place to go if you don't like sashimi, or if you have friends who don't like sushi much."
"They have great roles, the triple-color, and the Norwegian roles are great and fulfilling."
"A special roll and a regular roll will fill you up, but save room for dessert."
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert and a great green tea tempura.
The pre-dishes are delicious too!
Great food .
"Other, of a kind used for the manufacture of goods of heading 8106"
Good food.
I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this place delivers.
"The atmosphere was nice, but it was a little lacking."
"Despite the confusing mirrors, this will probably be my choice for modern Japanese food in the near future."
Indochina food is very good...
A very fancy place but not very good Chinese style Indian food
"Chicken is my favorite, most dishes (I must agree with a previous reviewer) are quite fatty and very spicy, especially the chili"
"My mother introduced me here, but even she (as an Indian) feels that the food is a little bit too spicy and way too fat."
I was silent because of the terrible food.
I was having dinner at the restaurant on holiday and the food was very disappointing.
"Instead of making vegetarian dishes, the chef gave me a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, herb, or other form or aesthetic presentation)."
This place just stays on the reputation.
"This is the finest restaurant in New York City, not just in Brooklyn."
"For seven years, they made the best, the best food and kept it that way."
"Never move, never a bad meal, never a bad service."
"Good food , good wine , good service in a good neighborhood ."
Patsy's pizza is true love.
Give me the best pizza in the world.
- Very well .
The hot dogs were juicy and soft inside and had a lot of crunch and snap from the outside.
A place to go to eat or have a lunch.
"I'm a little fat for it, but the experience is good."
A convenient service and an average price per dish.
All you see is the backdrop (not very pleasant).
Good food.
This place has great Indian Chinese food.
"Be prepared to wait, because the place is quite small."
"Although the place isn't nice, the food speaks for itself."
"The best Indian Chinese in town, by far!"
"I came by accident to the village underground, now I always go there."
The Martini's are great and very cheap.
"The service is great, I've had several servers and they've all been nice, which is a rare thing in New York."
"The DJ is great, I've been there for my birthday and a lot of other times with friends and I'm staying back."
Everything on the menu is great.
This is the real deal.
"I wish I had more of these places: intimate, superior food at home, top notch all around, definitely worth the wait."
But $500 for a dinner for two without wine?
The pre-dishes were very good.
The entrance was also very good.
What you pay is the environment and the name.
"Yeah, it's a stylish and beautiful place, but they're definitely focusing on the Uber Whealthy not the average Joe who just wants to do everything every now and then."
"Vanison was good, but not great."
"Bison was very good, though."
It was a disaster.
"I read reviews that said the restaurant was too expensive and I thought to myself, maybe it's worth it."
"The Four Seasons has a history and is a kind of New York City restaurant landmark, but believe me, they'll count you by the nose, so you can say,"
The food was great (except for dessert).
The surroundings are very luxurious and you'll see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just high-paid escorts.
"If you're going to get the food, it's not worth it."
You'd think they'd make it up to you with service.
"The service was great, it's not what you'd expect for $500."
I agree that eating at Casa la femme is like no other dining experience!
I just got home from a visit to Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit that I had to try and warn myself of other diners who value their time and money.
"We're late for our reservation, so I can't complain too much about waiting at a table."
It's beautiful. It's beautiful.
The hostess was very nice.
But our $14 drinks were terrible.
We also asked for hookah six times and the waiter told us a minute and never came back with the hookah.
"After the fourth time, I asked again, and the waiter said it after dinner."
"We asked for sides, and the waiter admitted that he had forgotten that part of our order."
My chicken was unedible because there were so many fat lumps that I had to keep spraying them in my napkin.
I didn't expect this for a $55 dinner.
"When we left, our wallets and stomachs were empty, and we missed the show we were supposed to see after dinner, which would have been acceptable if we could enjoy the good food and the belly dancing!"
"If it was possible to do that, I would have paid my bill, because my meal was inedible."
I've never left a restaurant and felt like I was being abused and wasting my hard-earned money.
The menu is pretty simple without much description.
"There was no tap beer that night, which was a disappointment."
We didn't pick any bottles of beer either.
"The pre-orders were fast-food - an order of baked oysters and mussels was delicious, but only a small portion (perhaps 3 of each)."
"The lobster bones were fine, but they were rather tasteless."
I think there were two shrimps in the salt-cropped shrimps.
"I had the Thai-style sea bass, which was really good."
"Everyone seemed happy with their food except for my brother who had the G-scream mahi mahi, which was apparently dipped in grapefruit juice."
I heard the hummer roll was excellent.
"The food was all good, a little on the expensive side, but fresh."
"The service is not the most friendly for our ""big party""!"
Indian food
"I love Indian food and I eat it regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've ever had."
"""A very normal Indian dish, but very well done."
"I got a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (net chicken tikka masala - no rice bread - is $25), which I would expect in a luxurious Indian restaurant, but this place doesn't feel luxurious"
"Also, waiters try to push you to eat more, like pretend things are complimentary when they actually cost $$."
"But if you're willing to spend some money and ask if something is free, this is the place to go for Indian food."
"The slogan says it all. ""Indian Spice Rave""."
"The lunch buffet is expensive, but it's worth it."
"We've only been to the diner a few times, but the quality and service are the same."
Bukhara is on my top five Indian places in New York.
I've never been more disgusted with both food and service.
"But when I got my predictable average order of what Dokebi thinks is Korean Fair (sometimes you have to settle for it if it's your only option), I had to go through about half my kimchi before I found a random slate with a much more disgusting, slimy, obviously bad piece of fish skin."
"My main concern was the health of the food being sent to me and others, but I would be lying if I said that as someone who worked in restaurants since I was 15, I expected the restaurant to do the least to improve the situation."
"My friend, who was a little more aggressive and made her as disgusting as she was throwing away the rest of her barely eaten meal, called back to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was probably an oyster and that we were also on the restaurant's blacklist."
"It wasn't like this restaurant had a lot of great points, but now it's just disgusting."
A beautiful place ideal for a romantic dinner.
I booked a beautiful white organza tent with a four-course menu that we really liked.
"The service was spectacular, the waiter knew all about the menu and his recommendations were great!"
I recommend Casa la femme for any special occasion and to impress your date.
"The bi-bapp was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to silent."
I wish I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.
The nakgi-bokum was terrible.
The worst roasted turkey I've ever tasted.
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than a decent Korean.
"The side dishes were fit, and I got a refill on request."
The real problem was the lack of service.
My wife had barely touched that dish mess.
"The woman had the risotto, which was great."
The Farro salad and the Yukon potatoes were also delicious.
"I like Margherita's pizza, I like East Village pizza."
We love this place every time we're in town.
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza
"The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity, the salt from the cheese is great, really enhances the flavor of all the other ingredients."
"I like the margarita pizza, but they're all good."
The most romantic restaurant in town.
"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (which doesn't serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!"
"It's not just an adventure to come to this somewhat hidden place as you walk through the unfamiliar wooden doors, the zen and intimate decorations will make you feel like you're no longer in the city."
"If you want to come here, make sure your date is someone you really like, because you'll be taken to private booths where there are no people or food watching (look at the booths on the ground floor that have glass ceilings so you can see the stars in the sky!)."
It's just you and your date and a little sweet once in a while. Forgive me before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!
My party had the BB$29 fixed price menu which was such a great deal because it also had a sake flight!
We started with a delicious sashimi amuse bouche.
"I chose the grilled black cod as my starter, which I absolutely ate while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better."
The sake has been very successful in the business world.
"For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame seeds (interesting but not unusual) and matcha (green tea in powder) and the blue beer cheesecake."
"Maybe it was the big company (I had friends from Philadelphia visiting me) or the super reasonable price, but I just can't say enough good things about this brasserie"
"I don't usually visit the same restaurant more than once, but I always come to Zenkichi for a quiet, unpolished and unforgettable dinner."
"The service leaves a lot to be desired, from the feeling of being rushed to the place of your order, to the fact that you're ignored for the rest of the night."
"They're extremely rude, they don't apologize for the terrible service we've been given and they give us a bill of over $500 for some drinks and their pita bread."
large shabu shabu
"I tried a few other dishes, but I wasn't very impressed."
"But for the Shabu Shabu, you're not much better off in New York."
"The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad for free with your meal and the service is good too."
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two shot of classic Korean food and fusion running like piggyback steak
"The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to come here is the fantastic pork sandwich perfect on his supermarket squishy b bun"
Restaurant with views
The food was very good.
Family law was very good.
The starter was also very good.
"The price is high, but the food is good, so I'll be back."
This is not a logical place.
"This place has a very strange decorative staircase with my mirror wall, and I'm surprised no one's ever broken their head or fallen off the stairs."
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
The concept of Japanese tapas is new and obviously not working.
"The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked."
Good food
"The food was great and delicious, but the seat was too small, I don't like cramps in a corner."
It was a very romantic place .
A colleague and I tried Pacificos after work a few Fridays and it was great.
The atmosphere was great.
"The food was excellent, but I wouldn't say the margaritas are something to write home about."
"Our waitress was not mean, but she wasn't very warm or attentive."
"I have to say, I'm surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier this year."
We're back and can't wait to visit the summer to use the patio.
The servers at the flatbush farm seem to have mastered a horrible technique to make you guilty and embarrass you to attract their attention.
"Another server added to the fun, throwing our entrances in front of us halfway through our pre-dinner (which was delicious)."
"Overall, the food quality was pretty good, although I hear that the salmon is much better off if it's not cooled for the guest."
"The place has nice equipment and attractive furniture and, as I could see, a reasonable wine list (I got the menu when I asked for the carte des vins)"
How's this palsy still open?
Everything was fine until we got our meals.
I looked at the chicken and was shocked.
"It was served with leather, on a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and potatoes."
"I've had a bite of the $24 salmon and in the 17 years I've been to restaurants, I've never touched salmon as fishy, dry, and soft as those on the flatbush farms."
"Right now, the waitress comes by and asks if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress walked away."
"So I contacted my friend to see if I could eat the meat and the spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just couldn't bite through it."
"The manager said there was absolutely nothing to do, it was a matter of taste that she didn't like it and I can't accept it."
"The manager came to the table and said we could do whatever we wanted, so we paid for what we enjoyed, the drinks and the food and walked away."
This staff needs to be fired.
Cirpy crust margarita pizza
It was a very good pizza.
The crust was beautifully cooked and the pizza was full:)
Worst single restaurant in Manhattan
I'll be with a few positive things: cool decor well P pita and hummus and G grilled octopus hat was actually really good.
"If I could give it zero stars , I 'd give it for this place ."
Where do I start?
It's a spectacular scene.
"The decor, however, seems to be the distraction, so you won't notice that you just paid $300 for a cold eggplant that took 2 bloody hours to arrive!!!!"
"How this place survives the competitive market of West Village in this economy, or any other, I'm not familiar with."
- Very good.
"Although it has often been busy here, they always deliver their food."
The hot dogs are great and the slamwich is great.
It's always going to be worth the train ride and will make your tongue and stomach very happy!
"The only complaint is the pricing, and I think it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less for every item on the menu."
But still... great joke great food
Fable food - if the staff of the house doesn 't sell you out .
"Every time we were there, the staff of the house (not the waiters - they're great - but the people who greet you and sit down) were so horrible to us that I would never come back without the exceptional fish dishes."
"Bfc doesn't take reservations, so you almost always have to wait at the bar and be abused by front desk staff until you sit down, which can be an hour later!"
The fresh retro girl (with winged / lady Edna glasses) will yell at you when you order a drink.
I'd be shocked if my staff rejected clients so early and so rude.
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" with brown hair, who listens to your conversation and calls in - except that she only hears the last part of what you said, so her unsolicited opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about."
"If you consider paying at least $60 a head, I expect better service."
"- ""Eat and go""."
"The food and the service were fine, but the master was incredibly unwilling and arrogant."
"As we finished our meals, including a bottle of fine wine, our son's fiance came to us for a glass of wine and dessert."
"This man refused to sit her down and she left, followed by the four of us, but not until I told him that in my 40 years of traveling the world, including Paris, I had never seen such bad behavior from a frontman in a restaurant."
"A word for the wise: you can't eat here and disturb the master's sense of turn around, as crazy as it is, otherwise."
The best meal in a long time!
Blades and calamari were wonderful Saturday night.
"I had the lamb special, that was perfect."
"My father had the flanke pocket that was very good, and my mother had the swordfish."
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.
The food is great and the environment is even better.
Bringing hot dogs to the next level
"At first glance, this seems a little expensive for a hot dog joint, but you don't get your average hot dog when you bark."
"Here, the hot dog is raised to a real entrance with many variations."
It's a nice atmosphere.
"I recommend the Fish Tacos, everything else was fine."
"The cool atmosphere of the fireplace in the back is a really good omen, but it needs a little more heat on a cold night."
Poor service and poor management
Don't go to this place.
I had a terrible experience at Casa la femme at a Saturday dinner.
The manager was rude and acted very badly.
I can't believe how an expensive restaurant is so disrespectful to its customers.
"The food is very good, but not excellent."
"It is not possible that it justifies the praise it receives, the attitude of the staff or the waiting at a table."
"Mistakes happen, but they're usually accompanied by an apology, maybe even a glass of wine, but not the grounds we got from the al di la staff."
"The bread was outdated, the salad was too expensive and empty."
"The pasta was well cooked, but not enough sauce or flavor."
"The hostess was rude, and I had a feeling they didn't want to serve us."
"The only thing my friend kept away was that when we were sitting at the bar, the bartender disappeared."
"I asked for a menu, and the same waitress looked at me like I was crazy."
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""Can I help you?"" and ""How many are at your party?"""
Shame on the rude staff and the nonexistent customer service.
Bad employees
I usually like this place.
The food is good.
The design of the space is good.
But the service is terrible!
"I was there for a brunch recently, and we were tagged by a waitress and a waitress"
The waiter brought us food while he saw a plastic garbage bag in one hand.
"The waitress came to us every few minutes and started cleaning the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet pain from me that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it)."
"I wish I liked this place more, and I wish someone would re-train the staff."
