"Staff have been nice, but they seemed very stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often."
"From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitress staff, I felt like a royalty and enjoyed every second."
"Considering that we were the last customers there and that it was after the closing, the waiters did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed."
"I highly recommend Russian caviar to anyone who wants delicious, top-quality caviar and fantastic service."
A traditional family-owned restaurant
fresh ingredients and everything is made on demand.
kind staff who really allows you to enjoy your food and the company you're with.
"I thought the food was excellent, particularly the salmon dish I ate."
I also ordered the mojito change that was out of this world.
"My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the next day to try the amount of cleaning that was good... not exceptional, but good."
"We ate in the backyard, which is worth it, because it's cool and the music is good there."
"Overall, great restaurant"
The food was good.
The place was nice and quiet.
But the service was a little slow.
The buffet had a good selection.
The food was medium or higher including some surprisingly tasty dishes
The service was very good too.
I have a great piece of cheesecake and we had some other good cakes.
"I'd recommend Roxy's for that, but not for her food."
My son and his girlfriend wanted cheese burgers and they were huge!
"As a result, their burgers fell apart in their hands and they made such a disaster that they didn't feel like finishing them."
I had a big pastrami sandwich in a roll.
"This place is very modern but they've forgotten the most important part of a restaurant, the food."
"The last two times I ordered from here my food was so spicy I could barely eat it, and the spice also moved away from the flavor of the dish."
And Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
"If you want a good, authentic Thai, this is not the place to go."
"We went to lunch here a couple weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was very impressed with the food."
"Pesto's pizza was excellent, thin-skinned pizza with a good amount of spicy Italian cheese I'd never heard of."
"The backyard is very nice, where you can see your personal lawn."
We had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic.
"My husband said he could have eaten several more, the serving was fine for me, even exclaimed that the chips were the best I had ever eaten."
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
We waited in the bar and we had martinis that were fine.
I love the food.
It's the only place you can get delicious authentic Japanese comfort food.
I've lived in New York for five years and this place has it all.
Great food good size m great menu service and a no-pretension fit
"The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the sardines of the lamb sausages with the whole large shrimp biscuits to the incredible pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had)."
I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare jewel in New York.
The best variety and fastest delivery
The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
We're very special about sushi and we both enjoyed each option that included: ceviche mix (special) c crab pie mix varied sashimi sushi nd rolls two kinds of sake and banana tempura
Definitely a great place for a good occasion or date.
Thai food is good but terrible
A Thai restaurant without rice for dinner?
"The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and wet."
"This is a wonderful place in every way, especially the value of money."
That's a great service.
"The waiter welcomed us without delay, very kind and cordial."
She was very helpful in suggesting drinks and helping us order many good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.
The food seemed very appetizing and delicious since it came in a variety of high dishes.
We ended our great experience with a gulab jamun (desert) recommended by the waiter.
"I thanked my friend for recommending this restaurant to me, and I will definitely recommend it to others."
"The service here was excellent, the food was fantastic."

You can't go wrong with this place.
"The food is excellent and the service is fast, friendly and very professional."
Always a good crowd but never strong.
I don't want to write because I don't want my pizza place to freeze.
By far the best pizza in Manhattan.

The menu has so many fish and oysters.
"The fish was very, very fresh."
We all agreed that Mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York.
I ran into this big pizza place while exploring my new neighborhood.
All the pizzas are fantastic and the price is even better!
I highly recommend Sophia's pizza.
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me swear I'd never come back.
"Right after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys get out of here."
"For people who want good food and great service, Roxy is a place to avoid."
"The first time the sushi was exceptional, the second time it was a little soft."
"The blonde wood decor is very relaxing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is excellent."
Mizu is the Japanese finding in grammar.
"While their cooking is delicious, their sushi is out of this world."
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls that are found nowhere else.
"Not only is the kitchen the best, the service has always been attentive and charming."
Warning: it can be difficult to dine in other Japanese restaurants after visiting Mizu
"Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people to serve you, but the food doesn't fit."
I ordered the smoked salmon and the roe snack and it was out of taste.
"The appetizer was soft and small, the dessert was uninspired."
I was expecting a little more from such an expensive menu.
The view is spectacular and the food is excellent.
And also wonderful strawberry daiquiri!
authentic Taiwanese food that's cheap... what else could you ask for?
The cold appetizer dishes taste the same as I remember growing up in Taiwan.
delicious simple food in a pleasant outdoor atmosphere
friendly and attentive waiting staff
I like scalops as much as mahi mahi (in saffron risotto!).
My friend ate her chicken and potato purée.
delicious crab cakes too.
"Even if the food wasn't that good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax."
Large neighborhood of the community
This is a good pizza place with a good selection of thin-skinned pizza including the basil slice.
"His pants are horrible, bad, they make you vomit, shit."
The hiring service is bad.
There's no pizza 33 for me!
"Doses are scarce, unattractive and drip with fat, and personally I would drink popcorn before eating another one of these."
"Sandwiches are dry, tasteless and very expensive."
"Calling the Hampton Chutney Co. place warns you that these people offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with useless employees there was also a lack of the first thing."
"Seriously, this place sucks."
"The atmosphere is unprecedented, the service is unparalleled and the food is magnificent."

"This is a great place to take foreigners, and perfect for watching the sunset."
A great sushi experience.

Try the sushimi cucumber roll
The drinks are very good and the cakes are very tasty.
But who says Murray is something about service
The service is terrible.
This place is not worth the price.
I love the pizza 33 .
I'm going out with friends and suddenly I'm hungry and I just want one thing... his pizza.
This little place in Williamsburg is always nice and amazing.
The pizza is delicious and the owner is one of the best in New York.
Cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee !
"Bagels are fine, but make sure you don't make any special requests!"
I ordered him a cheese sandwich with my face open and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
Don 't worry about anything but bagels .
Turkey burgers are scary!
The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever found.
The udon soup was soy sauce and water.
The sushi was horrible!
The rice was of poor quality and was so badly cooked that it was hard.
"Besides, the rice had no seasonings, so sushi was soft and disgusting."
"The fish was adequate, but cut inexperimentally."
"Obviously, no one at the restaurant has any idea or experience with Japanese cuisine."
Good service fast
The food is excellent and cheap.
The location is perfect.
"Well, this place is so ghetto, it's not even funny."
If you like the music that's made you fly and the system's not that good and you want to pay at least $100 for a bottle of Minimum then you'll love it here.
"A wonderful pizza, especially the slice of Margarita."
Great atmosphere and worth everything.
Winnie and her staff are the best team you can find serving you.
The food is reliable and the price is moderate.

The place was quiet and charming.
The service was good and the food was wonderful.
I didn't try caviar but I tried its salmon and crab salad (they're all good)
It's definitely a good place for snacks and chat.
"As a retired hipster, I can say with some certainty that for the past year Lucky Strike has been the best relaxed night in town."
"The wait staff is nice, fun and mostly wonderful (in the form of wonderful aesthetic beauty, not in the way that she's more beautiful than me)."
"The food is delicious, especially its perfectly cooked mussels in spicy tomato sauce and its crispy fries"
But the best thing about LS is that the night atmosphere is deliciously BTS-free.
You can get a completely delicious Martini in a glass (which is 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend vanilla shanty mmmm!) in a big home that plays great music
"The Saturday night house DJ has a very good taste in music, and besides, she accepts requests."
You can't go wrong with this place.
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (schools) too.
"Its good location and the fact that Hutner College is nearby and its prices are very reasonable, makes students come back to Suan again and again."
I love your Thai people.
Noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the thing to do!
I'll be back in Suan soon!
In summer-eat out on a terrace (another great feature of suan)!!!
I can't imagine a more friendly staff working in a restaurant.
I can't imagine any better Indian food in the whole city.
"In the last three months, the chef and staff have changed and it hasn't been for the better."
The food is inconsistent now.
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and keep a secret.
The setting is casual and romantic.
The food is excellent!
"If you have the courage, try balsamic vinegar on ice cream. It's wonderful!"
You don't get hamburgers no matter what the critics say.
"The rest of the minimum amount, though very expensive by Chinatown standards, is worth it."
"The wait here is long for Dim Sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical noisy atmosphere of Dim Sum isn't your job, this is a stylish alternative (for Chinatown)."
Some tips: skip the cranberry cake and the pork toast and egg cakes
The food was exceptional.
"I chose to go with one of the specials, the lamb in red wine that was excellent."
The service was friendly and the atmosphere casual.
The restaurant is a little noisy but that's something you can overlook once you sit down and enjoy a good meal.
This little place has a nice interior decoration and affordable prices from the city.
"The pad chicken was delicious, but the pad thai was too fat."
"I've eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good."
The fries are great!
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant
This place would be much better served by a group that really understands customer service
"Terrible, terrible management - it deserves to be closed."
Delicious bagels especially when they come straight out of the oven.

The service is quick and friendly.
"Well, it's a matter of opinion, some might consider it a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying."

You should try the shrimp snacks.
This place has the right atmosphere and excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.
"Great food, prices, service."
"If you're looking for good quality, cheap food, this is the place."
It's a perfect place to eat amazing Indian food.
"I loved the different, innovative touch the chef gives to the food."
It's also great to have dinner in a very romantic and comfortable place.
"Your bagels are fine, but they're a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience."
Big bagels did the old fashioned thing.
The downside: service is slow and they don't serve!
The food was absolutely amazing!!
The baked clam octopus we shared as snacks was the best we've ever had!!
"The lamb was so tender and full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!"
The waiter was watching.
The bar scene seems to be happening.
"Dinner in the city center 2002 - solution price: snacks were fine, the waiter gave me a bad suggestion.. try the best Kanish potato stuff one."
Small portions for the main course I had salmon (I wasn't impressed) bride had chicken was good.
The dessert is a joke... don't bother
"Virgins or weekly clients, they're all treated the same way and you can't ask for more than that when the service is so friendly."
The restaurant has a no less familiar feel for the huge portions of p; the calf could only have solved the Third World famine on its own.
"The anti-paste was excellent, especially the squid, as well as the filling pastes."
The list of wines is extensive and you can easily go through a meal of another reasonable price
"Still, any dispute over the bill was compensated by measures of pouring their own liquor that were courtesy of the house..."
A fantastic place
Lucky strike is a great place to eat.
Great food great decoration great service
"This is the perfect place to meet friends, have lunch, dinner, drink before or after the theater."
(always ask the bartender for seasonal beer !!)
A great vacation spot to meet coworkers or friends you haven't seen in a while.
I've been doing all of this at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years and I've never been disappointed!
What a wonderful place
It's not the typical NYC themed restaurant.
A fresh bar with good food and tons of excellent beer
The shrimp was excellent and the pastries were abundant.
"If you venture to Manhattan Island and can't find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona."
The only thing more wonderful than food (which is exceptional) is the service
The only thing the waiters don't do for you is clean your chin when you leave.
A romantic atmosphere with only 15 tables at most.
The service was very fast but a little rushed.
"The food was very good, but not what I would consider outside this world."
It's a shame the food wasn't from the same heritage.
"The special pork pasta was bad taste, as was the seafood tagliatelle."
But it wasn't the cake enamel: a tiramisu that didn't look like anything he'd ever had.
I really liked this place.
This place has the best Chinese-style ribs in town.
I also recommend rice dishes or different congee varieties (rice drops)
It's definitely not a place to go if you want to impress someone.
"However, if you want a good meal at a good price and you don't care about the decorations you can't beat this place."
Fast and friendly service
"When you're sitting in his main dining room (which has a spectacularly high, hand-painted ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside."
"The food is wonderful, tasty and satisfying, and the service is professional and friendly."
I can't wait for summer when they serve out in their giant yard.
I tried Suean recently and I thought it was great.
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you get a lot of food for your money.
The service was quick and pleasant and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to their meals.
Good food
A good drink
I've never eaten cheese like this.

with chicken b beef and lamb dishes

I'm going to skip the dessert.
The best Rubén sandwich of all time!
Don't miss Bloom's visit on your next trip to Manhattan.
"It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we'll stop when we leave the city on our next trip to New York."
Thanks to Bloom for a lovely trip.
"The food was not fresh, the sauces were soft and very oily."
The pizza was a little wet.
Ravioli was good... but I have to say everything seemed a little too expensive.
There's not enough wine in the glass either.
"However, the service was excellent... and I really liked the atmosphere."
"The food was medium... if prices were lowered a little, it would be a bigger attraction."
This place is a big deal.
authentic Pakistani food

The fan is very good.
The best pad thai I ever had.
The design and the environment are just as good.

"Muscles were the heaviest things I'd ever tasted, the watermelons were soft, the goat cheese salad was weird from goat cheese, the chicken penis had bones in it... it was disgusting."
The service was nice and the desert was good.
The jukebox plays everything from Italian opera to the punches.
"The food is amazing, rich pastries and fresh pizza and pasta."

Come here for the drinks
Drinks are amazing and half off until 8:00.

My favorite was the bad girl .
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.
I really recommend the very simple rolls of wave (egg)
Sweet onion or onion eggs and a roti of chickpeas
"Toons has been recently renovated, so it's now a very attractive space."
The food is as good as ever.
"In an area that, sadly, lacks decent Thai food this is one of the best places."
"I was here last night, the decor is good, but the food was surprisingly excellent."
"The portions are huge, so it might be good to order three things to divide (instead of an appetizer and an appetizer per person) for two people."
The best rice and spicy soup battalions in town!
The beef noodle soup is good too.
The service is good and the restaurant is clean.
The best Taiwanese food in New York!
I've been to Rao's probably 15 times in the last 3 years and it's still getting better.
Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in New York.
My roommate and I love this place.

The interior was very cozy and lovely.
"The serving sizes here are huge, and sushi is good."
The staff is very accommodating.
Excellent pastels served in the middle of a clean and elegant decoration
"I got the $10 combo of 10 pieces, each piece of which was great."
The decor is very simple but comfortable.
The food was delicious but don't come here on an empty stomach.
The portions are small but the fact that the food was so good makes up for that.
You should eat the crab meat lasagna that's out of this world and the chocolate bread in desserts.
The staff there is very attentive and grounded.
Indian food is excellent and the service is amazing.
The owner really caters to all your needs.
The food is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.
The food here does a great service to the name (in Cantonese it's...).

This dish is my favorite and I always have it when I go there and I never get tired of it.
Try congee and donut as a fried dough they call ow law soh a delicious sweet flavored bread.
Just a good taste of Chinese food at incredible prices...
Service isn't what you're here for...
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach.
"Whoever the jazz duo was, they were on point."
Good music great food fast service affordable prices.
Even the wine by the glass was good.
consistently good Japanese tapas
There's always good drinks and the service is pretty good.
The atmosphere is pleasant and relaxed too...
A great place to gather for food and drink...
Yakitori (BBQ meat) is also tasty.
"If you don't mind a low-quality pre-cut fish, a hostile staff and a sushi chef who looks miserable, then this is your place."
The price and quality of the fish alone will prevent us from making a return visit.
I wasn't going to share but I feel obliged... while I was sitting at the sushi bar having dinner we watched the chef accidentally leave a piece of unagi on the floor and as he recovered it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.
This place that's only a few months old is perhaps Queen's biggest secret.
"Fabulous decoration - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very good food at a low price, generally personal friendly and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home... very soho/town/Upper West Side minus the expensive and pretentious clientele...all on Roosevelt Avenue!"
We were sitting outside and the waiter poured red wine and hot tea on me and my girlfriend.
"You'd think we'd apologize or get free drinks, but we have a snobbie waiter who doesn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us a lip when we asked him to."
"With so many good restaurants at UW, I don't need too expensive, absurdly arrogant food, waiting staff doesn't recognize that they work in a glorified restaurant, clumsy service, and my management hat doesn't matter."
I'm relatively new to the area and I tried to pick a Bgel in 2nd and I was disappointed with the service and thought the food was overloaded and on the expensive side.
The food is good and the prices here are mediocre.
Balushi's has solid food and nice decoration at reasonable prices.
The only problem is the manager is a complete incompetent.
He's a low-level service and has no personality.
There's no excuse for such a terrible service.
I've never had 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri before.
$20 for everything you can eat sushi can't be beat.

"Most servers are very attentive, kind and quite attractive."
"The atmosphere was very relaxed and welcoming, the service was excellent, and the food was excellent!"
The food was good and the view of New York City was amazing even on a rainy day like the one I went to.
Although they ask the typical questions of what kind of water you'd like the service was good and generally very relaxing to eat.
The food is excellent.
Personal pots are the perfect size for those hungry nights.
There's a disadvantage if you're ordering... delivery types have an important attitude.
I've never had a guy so dramatic (a lot of sigh and sigh and whisper under the breath) that always seems disappointed with his tips.
"I love the scene first of all, the place has a nice character and a nice light, very lucky, with location."
The pizza was pretty good and huge.
"We were four years old and we got the size of our family, a vodka penny that was a tremendously giant portion -- literally a bucket of food."
"Penny pasta was pretty extra butter, creamy which means a big dig job... tasty at first but I'd say it was full of a slice of pizza and seven to count, Penny..."
Rosa comes in and I think they're doing better.
"Interesting selection of good service wines, fun decoration"
"I found it on a cold night, the perfect place to warm up."
I got a quick service with a smile.
This place has left me lifeless... my new favorite restaurant upstairs.
The wine list is extensive and impressive.
"I love the atmosphere, I felt like Paris."
"The muskets were fantastic and the dessert was fantastic, and it'll definitely be back soon."
I've been coming here for years and I have nothing else to say about the services and the great staff at The Lantern.
"Over the years the host, Vittorio and his team have always treated me like a family... although with all the business this jewel does not so small, it is surprising that it is even able to remember a constant but not so frequent visitor."
I've also been surprised by all the new additions in recent years: a new jazz bar the most fantastic food garden the best of the thin-skinned pizzas and now a lasagna menu that's for dying (these aren't average lasagnas)!
I love this place.
"I have to say, I've never had a disappointing meal here."
We could have made a meal of the delicious cookies from the cookie menu.
"Luckily, we saved up space for the salmon and the crispy duck."
Love to the day
I recommend this place to everyone.
Good food
"The pastries are amazing, the risottos (especially the sepia are fantastic and the brown bunny B is amazing."
The food here was mediocre at best.
It was totally too expensive... fish and chips were about 15 bucks...
Sweet dog
An amazing organic dog and an ecologically conscious establishment
The Cypriot restaurant has a lot to do.
But the best pig suvukki I've ever had is the main thing.
This is a very delicious pizza.
I was visiting New York with a friend and we discovered this very warm and welcoming restaurant
I love eggplant pizza and pie pie.
"We had half the pizza, mine was grapefruit and my friend had the buffalo and it was huge for a small size pizza!"
"Great food, but the inside should need some help."
"Space feels like an Alice on the Wonderland stage, without trying to be that."
"I only paid about 60 bucks for a good meal, though:"
Big sake
Fresh and reliable sushi
Sashimi is always fresh and rolls are innovative and delicious.
I've never had any trouble with the service except for one lost rice once.
Delivery may or may not be timely depending on the time and day of the week.
Sometimes the delivery type gets upset if you don't tip yourself more than 10%.
The best sushi of all.
This place ruined me for the sushi in the neighborhood.
Excellent sashimi and the M Millenium roll is more than delicious.
"The place is a little hidden, but once you get there, it's worth it."
It's not just the food.
"The waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were magnificent."
A perfect place to relax and enjoy your dinner
There's something in their atmosphere that makes me come back almost every week.

My favorite good food is seafood spaghetti
Excellent food at very high prices
The waiting room staff is very polite and accommodating.
"Space is limited so prepare to wait for 45 minutes - 1 hour , but be richly rewarded when you taste the delicious Indo-Chinese food"
My favorite place lol

I'm not necessarily a fan of this place but it was a fun time for the bass.

It had no taste and the staff is rude and not attentive.
I love this place.
The service was quick and kind.
I thought the restaurant was clean and nice.
I ordered the Vittello alla Marsala and I was very impressed.
The meat and the mushrooms were perfectly cooked.
The potato balls weren't dry at all... they were actually butter.
The worst place on Smith Street in Brooklyn
"The very immature bartender didn't know how to make specific drinks, the service was so slow, the food was neither cool nor hot, the waitresses were busy flirting with men in the bar and they weren't paying much attention to all the customers."
"I would never recommend this place to anyone, even for a casual dinner."
The food is always fresh ...
Japanese food too expensive with mediocre service
Did the chicken teriyaki have tomatoes or peppers on top?
The food was very hot.
The waitress wasn't paying attention.
I was looking for a banana-tempered dessert and they don't have it.
Not because you're the Four Seasons... you're entitled to charge an arm and a leg for a romantic dinner.
"The food was excellent and the service, however, I let the four seasons down."
"I don't think dinner in Manhattan should cost $40,000 where I don't sweep my feet."
"Red dragon roll - my favorite food, of any food group - hands down"
Just go to Yamato and order the red dragon roll
Seafood dynamite is also from another world.
I love sushi in New York.
"A little pretentious place on the park side, sushi is consistently good, service is pleasant, effective and modest."
"In the summer months, the backyard is very nice."
The rolls are creative and I haven't found another sushi place that serves more inventive and delicious Japanese food yet.
"The dance, the white river and the rolls of the millennium are the most."
I can eat here every day of the week. I really love this place.
Raw food wow-
I can't remember the last time I had such nasty food in New York.
My quesadillas tasted like they were made by a three-year-old boy with no sense of proportion or taste.
And $11 for a soft guacamole dish .
Don't make me start with the margaritas either.
"Oh, and I never write reviews... I was just so moved by how bad this place was, I felt it was my duty to spread the word."
Good Indian food
"The food was good, the place was clean and affordable."
I noticed that a lot of Indian people ate there which is a great sign for an Indian place
"This is one of my favorite places , very relaxing the food is great all the time , celebrated my engagement and my wedding here , was very well organized ."
The staff is very good.
I love your drink menu.
I highly recommend this beautiful place.
They offered us water for the table but didn't tell us Voss's water bottles were $8 a piece.
The food was good.
Good view of the river and New York
Great service
A well-designed Egyptian dream restaurant that gets staged at night.
Watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy the delicious Baba Gonaush that is lemon rather than smoke.
"Oh, and there's a hook"
Raymond the bartender has gotten himself into the rock!
Pacific is a great place to hang out.
"The drinks are great, especially when they're Raymond's."
The brunch tortilla is great...
"The spinach is fresh, definitely not frozen..."
"Quacamole in the Pacific is delicious, like wings with chimmichuri."
One of his weaknesses is chicken in salads.
"Also, I personally wasn't a fan of the bagel and the asparagus mole."
"In general, decent food at a good price, with nice people."
Best Indian restaurant in town
"The decor needs to be improved, but the food is amazing!"
This little place in Astoria Souvlaki does what many consider the best tours in New York.
"What really makes it shine is the food that is aggressively seasoned with cirpriot spices, and everything made at home (including turkey and sausages, and made from much higher quality ingredients than you might otherwise expect."
"All the Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the turn is the reason to come... if you don't eat one your trip was a waste."
The best restaurant in Brooklyn
Great food amazing service This place is a class act.
The beef was amazing last night.
This place is a place to visit!
Most cabins allow you to sit next to each other without looking like a couple.
The food is shared so we can order together and eat together.
My daughter's wedding reception on the waterfront received the highest praise from our guests.
Everyone loved the atmosphere (elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views and fabulous food)
The service was wonderful .
"Paul the D Master, he was totally professional and always on top of things."
Thank you all at the water's edge.
"Okay, but it's not nice, the bathroom's dirty."
"The high prices you're gonna pay are for the sight, not the food."
"The drinks at the bar were, to say the least, good."
The tilapia thing was horrible... tasted like cardboard.
"We thought dessert would be better, it's not like that!"
"Speaking of bathroom, men's bathroom was disgusting."
"The list of wines was extensive, although the staff did not seem to have any knowledge of the wine combinations."
The bread we received was horrible - hard and cold - and the free olive snack was disappointing.
"However, our main course was wonderful."
"I had fish and my husband had steak, both of them exceeded our expectations."
"The dessert (we took a pear cake was good - but, again, the company staff as unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions."
"When we asked about ports, the waitress listed several but didn't know the taste variations or the cost."
It's not what I expected for the price and prestige of this place.
"I'd usually come back, since it was a beautiful restaurant, but I hope the staff will pay more attention to the little details in the future."
"It's a very nice, short place, romantic, cozy and private."
Both aren't as small as some of the reviews make them look perfect for two people.
The service was extremely fast and attentive thanks to the service button on his desk) but I barely understood a word when the waiter took our order.
The food was good and there was nothing to drive me crazy.
In every way the place looks better than the real meals
"So what you actually end up paying for is the restaurant, not the food."
Subtle food and services
noodle pudding is exactly the kind of service and food I enjoy.
"The servers are different, Greg is my favorite."
"Sometimes the desk staff don't understand your sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a server who has personality, professionalism and respects the privacy of your dinner."
It's the first place a runner remembers my order... I hope he likes his job because I have half the mind to steal it for my restaurant.
Prices are fair in all areas for both food and beverage
"I go out to eat and I like my courses, the servers are patient and never rush the courses or force another drink."
Amazing fresh dogs but the best of all are the infinite tops !!
This place had all the ornaments and I mean everything.
Amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out!!!!
Getting into House the Femme last night was a real experience unlike any other in New York!
"Very impressed with the decorations to the food, the hospitality and the great night I had!"
Have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemons and lemon juice and mint leaves that's for dead!
"The food took a while to prepare, it's all worth the wait."
He lured us to the belly dance show that captivated the crowd.
I never write on these sites but this restaurant is worth praising!
Magicians in food
"The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average."
"However, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a worm in the mushroom sauce at the bottom."
I showed it to the manager and he apologized smiling and brought us two desserts for free (but he didn't ask us what we wanted and so he brought the last two desserts we would have ordered).
"The manager finally said that it would comprise the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the meal), and made it seem like a big concession."
"I've worked in restaurants and cooked a lot, and there's no way a worm can get into a well-prepared meal."
"For a restaurant with a good reputation and that's usually so crowded, there was no reason for a lack of intelligent customer service."
I have hair on my food twice !
A very valuable place.
"The food is tasty, plentiful and reasonably priced."
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.
It's a great place to ask or sit.
The sushi experience was amazing with my fiancee.
Good creative roles
"Yamato is a great place to go if you don't like sashimi, or if you have friends who don't like sushi very much."
They have big triple-colored rolls and Norwegian rolls are amazing and full.
"A special roll and a regular roll is enough to fill, but save space for dessert"
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert as well as a great tempura green tea
The snacks are delicious too!
Amazing food
"Other, of a kind used for the manufacture of goods"
Good food
I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this place offers.
"The atmosphere was pretty nice but it was missing a little bit, which he tries to compensate with a crazy mirror scheme."
"Despite the confusing mirrors, this will probably be my favorite for modern Japanese food in the near future."
The indo-Chinese food is very good...
A very elegant but not very good Indian Chinese-style place
"Chicken is my favorite, most dishes (I have to agree with a previous critic) are quite fatty and very spicy, especially chicken chicken"
"My mother introduced me to this place originally, but even she (being Indian) feels that food can be a bit spicy and too fat."
I was speechless about the horrible food.
"I went to a vacation dinner at the restaurant, and the food was very disappointing."
"Instead of preparing a vegetarian dish, the chef offered me a steamed vegetable dish (salsa less, condiments or any shape or aesthetic presentation)."
This place survives only by its reputation.
"This is the most wonderful restaurant in all of New York, not just Brooklyn..."
For seven years they've brought out the most delicious and tasty food and kept it like this...
"It never swings, never a bad meal never a bad service."
"Great food , great wine list , great service in a big neighborhood ."
The pizza of the patz = true love
Deliver the best pizza on the planet.
He 's a good hot dog .
Hot dogs were juicy and tender on the inside and had a lot of crunch and snap on the outside.
Great topping definitely a place you need to see for late lunch or a midday drive!
"I think the dishes are a little greasy, but the overall experience of the dinner is good."
useful service and average price per plate of $10.
The only thing that catches your eye is the decoration (not very nice).
Good food
This place has a great Indian Chinese food
"Get ready to wait, because the place is pretty small."
"Although the place isn't beautiful, the food speaks for itself."
"The best Indian Chinese in town, by far!"
"I ran into the village subway by accident, now I go there all the time."
Martinis are incredible and very economical.
"The service is amazing, I've had different waiters and they've all been nice, which is a rare thing in New York."
"The DJ is great, I've been there for my birthday and a lot of other times with friends and keep coming back."
Everything on the menu is great.
This establishment is the real deal.
"I wish I had more of these places: intimate food, excellent home, first class all the way, definitely worth the wait."
But $500 for a dinner for two that doesn't include wine?
"Look, the snacks were really good."
The entrance was also very good.
What you're paying for is the environment and the name.
"Yeah, the place is elegant and beautiful, but they certainly point to the Uber Whealthy not the average Joe who wants to go out every once in a while."
"Vanison was good, but not incredible."
"However, the bison was quite excellent."
Desert is a mess.
"I read reviews that said the restaurant was too expensive and I thought, maybe it's worth it."
"The four seasons have history and it's kind of a landmark for New York City restaurants, but believe me, they'll charge you for the nose just so you can say, ""I've been to the four seasons restaurant""."
"Overall, the food was excellent (except desserts."
The atmosphere is very elegant and you'll see many rich guys with trophy-wearing wives or well-paid escorts.
"If you go for the food, it's not worth it."
"You think they'd make it up to you with the service, sadly?"
"The service was fine, not what you expected for $500."
I agree that dinner at Casa la Femme is like no other dinner experience!
I literally just got home from visiting Casa La Femme and I was so offended by my visit that I felt it was necessary to try to warn other diners who value their money and their time.
We're late for our reservation so I can't complain too much about waiting for a table.
This place is beautiful!
The hostess was very nice.
Yet our $14 drinks were horrible!
We also ordered the hook six times and the waiter would tell us a minute and never come back with the hook.
After the fourth time I asked him again and the waiter said that after our dinner.
We ordered sides that the waiter admitted he forgot to put that part of our order.
My chicken was unedible because there were so many pieces of fat I had to keep spitting on my napkin.
I wasn't expecting it for a $55 dinner.
"When we left, our wallets were full and our stomachs were full, and we missed the show we were supposed to see after dinner, which would have been acceptable if we could enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancing."
"If it seemed possible to do so while I was there, I would have fought my bill since my portion of dinner from my meal was painless!"
"I've never left a restaurant feeling abused, and wasting my money."
The menu is pretty simple without much description.
"There was no tap beer that night, which was a disappointment."
"It wasn't a big beer selection bottled either, we went with Brahma."
The snacks we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a small serving (maybe 3 of each).
"The lobster knots were fine, but pretty unbeatable."
"I think there were 2 shrimp in the ""shrimp with salt inlay"" snack."
"I ate the Thai-style fried seafood, which was really good."
"Everyone seemed happy with their food except my brother who had mahi mahi on the grill, apparently soaked in grape juice!"
I heard lobster roll was excellent.
"Everything in the food was good, a little on the expensive side, but fresh."
"The service is not the nicest for our ""big party""!"
Good Indian food
"I love Indian food and I eat it quite regularly, but I can say that this is one of the best I've ever had."
"""A lot of normal Indian food, but very well made."
"I got a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (only chicken tikka masala - no rice bread - is $25), which I would expect in a luxurious Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have a luxurious feel"
"Also, the waiters try to push more food on you, like suggesting things as if they're honorable when they actually cost $$."
"But if you're willing to spend something and remember to ask if something they offer is free, then this is the place to go for Indian food."
"The motto says it all... ""Dream of Indian spices"""
The lunch buffet is expensive but it's worth it.
We've only had dinner a few times but we're offered the same quality and service.
Bukhara is in my top 5 Indian places in New York
I've never been so disgusted with food and service.
"However, once I received my mediocre predictable order of what Dokebi thinks happens as the Korean fair (sometimes you have to solve when it's your only option), I went through half my kimchi before finding a random piece of lettuce accompanied by a much more disgusting, sticky, clearly bad piece of fish skin."
"My main concern was the health of the food they were sending to me and others, but I would be lying if I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of 15, I expected at least a minimal effort from the restaurant to make things better."
"My girlfriend, being a little more aggressive, and having been equally disgusting making me throw the rest of her food away just as food called back just to be informed that she was probably wrong and that it was very likely an oyster, and that we were also on the blacklist of her restaurant."
"It wasn't like this restaurant had big points of bragging before the hand, but now it's just repulsive."
A wonderful place ideal for a romantic dinner.
I booked a beautiful white organza shop that included a four-course menu that we really liked.
"The service was spectacular, the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!"
I recommend Casa the woman for any special occasion and to impress your date.
"The bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to whistling."
Too bad I had to pay two extra dollars for the stone bowl.
The nakgi-bokum was horrible.
easily the worst fried squid I've ever tasted.
The sauce tasted better at Chinese fast food than decent Korean.
"The side dishes were passing, and I got a filling on request."
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.
My wife had barely touched that dish disaster.
"The wife ate the risotto, which was amazing."
The farrow salad and the yucca potato puree were also extremely tasty.
I love the pizza Margarita I love the pizza from the east village
loving this place every time we're in town is one of the places we always go.
A slice of pizza from NYC.
"The bark has a good bite and a good chewing, the sauce is light with a good acidity, the salt in the cheese is great, it really increases the flavor of all the other ingredients."
"Personally, I like margarita pizza better, but they're all good."
Probably the most romantic restaurant in town.
"This is definitely my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (which doesn't serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!"
It's not just an adventure to get to this somewhat hidden place once you walk into the wooden doors without a zen mark and the intimate decor will make you feel like you're no longer in the city.
"If you plan on coming here, make sure your date is someone you like, as you'll be taken to private cabins where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the floor with glass roofs so you can see the stars in the sky!)."
Just you and your girlfriend and a cute occasional one!
My party had the BBE $29 Fix Prix menu which was a wonderful deal since it also came with a sake flight!
We start with a delicious sashimi amuse bouche
"I chose the black cod on the grill as my entry, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grill salmon dish was better."
The sake has made a good compliment to the courses and is successfully introducing me to the sake world.
"For desserts, we tried frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (green tea in powder) and blueberry cheese cookie which was phenomenal."
"Maybe it was the big company (I had friends visit me from Philadelphia) or the super reasonable price, but I can't say enough good things about this brewery"
"I don't visit the same establishment more than once, or more than twice, but I'll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried, memorable dinner."
"The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling rushed to the place of your order, to being ignored for the rest of the night."
"They're extremely rude, they don't even apologize for the horrible service we've been given and they bill us over $500 for some drinks and their pita bread."
Very good shabu shabu
I tried other dishes but I wasn't very impressed.
But for Shabu Shabu you won't find much better in New York.
"The meat is fresh, the sauces are excellent, you get kimchi and a free salad with your food and the service is good too."
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right punch of two classic Korean food and fusion turns like pig belly sticks
"Hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to come here is the fantastic perfect pork croquet sandwich at your supermarket b b b"
Restaurant with view
The food was really good.
The family's seafood was very good.
The main entrance was also very good.
"The price is high but the food is good, so I'd come back again."
This place doesn't make sense.
This place has totally strange decorative stairs that go up with m mirror walls I'm surprised how nobody's ever broken their head or fallen off the stairs-- mirror walls make you dizzy and delusional...
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
The Japanese cap concept is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
"The food they serve is uncomfortable, unappetizing and unprepared."
Good food
"The food was excellent and tasty, but the seating space was too small, I don't like to be cramped in a corner."
It was a very romantic place .
A colleague and I tried Pacific after work on Fridays and we loved it.
The atmosphere was great.
"The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say margaritas were something to write home about."
"Our waitress wasn't bad, but she wasn't too warm or attentive."
But I must say I'm surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier this year.
"We'll be back, though, and we can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the yard."
The flatbush farm servants seem to have perfected that horrible technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for appointing you to attract their attention.
"A different server increased the fun, throwing our tickets in front of us halfway through our snack (which was delicious)."
"Overall, the quality of the food was quite good, although I've heard that salmon is much better when it hasn't cooled down in front of the guest."
"The place has some good equipment some attractive furniture and, as far as I could tell, a reasonable wine list (they gave me the food menu when I ordered the wine list)"
How is this mattress open?
Everything was fine until we got our meals.
I looked at the chicken and I was horrified.
"Served with leather, on a bed of very little cooked spinach and potato puree."
"I've only eaten a single $24 salmon and in the 17 years I've been to restaurants, I've never tasted fish salmon, dry and soft like that on the Flatbush farms."
"At this point, the waitress comes in and asks if everything was okay, I was literally so surprised that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress left."
"So I switched with my boyfriend again to see if I could take the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked I couldn't bite it."
"This is where it really gets bad: the manager said, there's absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that he didn't like, and I can't compose it."
"The manager came to the table and said we could do whatever we wanted, so we paid for what we enjoyed, the drinks and snacks and we went out."
This staff must be fired.
"Other, of a thickness of not more than 0,5%"
It was a really good pizza.
The crust was incredibly well cooked and the pizza was completely loaded:):)
The worst restaurant in Manhattan
I'll be with a couple of positives: great decoration good P pita and hummus and G gorry octopus hat was really quite tasty.
If I could give you 0 stars I would for this place
"This place... God, where do I start?"
It's a spectacular scene.
The decor seems to be the distraction so you won't realize you just paid $300 for a cold pineapple that took 2 hours to arrive!!!!
"How this place survives the competitive West Village market in this economy, or any other, is something I can't understand."
The big hot dogs
"Although it's been full most of the time I've been here, the barking always delivers his food."
"Hot dogs are first class, and they're an amazing slamwich!"
"Stealing is worth the train ride, and it will make your tongue and your belly very happy."
The only complaint is the price... I think it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less for every item on the menu
But still... great place great food
fabulous food - if the front staff doesn 't discourage you .
"Every time we've been, the front desk staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet you and sit you down) has been so horrible to us that if it wasn't for the exceptional fish dishes, I would never come back."
"Since the BFC doesn't take reservations, you almost always have to wait in the bar and be abused by front-house staff until you sit down, which can be more than an hour later!"
The retro frzzy girl (with winged glasses / lady Edna) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.
I'd be horrified if my staff rejected clients so early and so rude!
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" brown hair, she listens to your conversation and listens to your rudder, except she only listens to the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about."
"Considering you'll be spending at least $60 a head, I expect better service."
"""I stayed and got out of here"""
"The food and service were fine, yet the teacher was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant."
As we finished our meals that included a bottle of high-quality wine our son-in-law joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.
"This guy refused to sit down and left, followed shortly after by the four, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of traveling the world, including Paris, I had never seen a bad behavior from a leader in a restaurant."
"One word for the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the teacher's sense of ""turning the table"", as crazy as he is, or vice versa."
The best meal in a long time!
The mussels and squid were excellent on Saturday night.
I had the special lamb that was perfect.
"My father had the flan steak that was very good, and my mother had the swordfish."
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.
The food is excellent and the environment is even better.
Take hot dogs to the next level
"At first glance this place looks a little expensive for a hot dog restaurant, but in barking you don't just get your average hot dog"
Here the hot dog rises to the level of a real appetizer with numerous variations available.
The atmosphere is great
I highly recommend fish tacos. Everything else was fine.
The fresh air in the fireplace in the back really advertises it but needs a little more heat on a cold night.
Poor service and management
Don't go to this place.
She had a terrible experience at Casa la Femme at a Saturday dinner.
The manager was rude and handled the situation very badly.
I can't believe an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its customers.
"The food is very good, but not exceptional."
"There's no way to justify the praise you get, the staff attitude or waiting for a table."
"Mistakes happen, but they're usually accompanied by an apology, maybe even a glass of wine... but not the groaning we get from Al Di La staff"
"The bread was outdated, the salad was too expensive and empty."
"The pasta was well cooked, it didn't have enough sauce or flavor."
The hostess was rude and I had a feeling they didn't want to serve us.
The only thing my friend left out was that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.
"I asked her for a menu, and the same waitress looked at me like I was crazy."
"I was surprised that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""I can help you"" and ""How many are at your party?"""
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and nonexistent customer service.
personal illness
I generally like this place.
The food is good.
The design of the space is good.
But the service is horrible!
"I was there for brunch recently, and we were accompanied by a waitress and a waiter."
The waiter delivered the food to us while holding in one hand what looked like a plastic garbage bag.
"The waitress would come to visit us every few minutes, and she started cleaning the dishes while half of us were still eating (a big bite of my pet that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it)."
"I'd like to like this place better, and I'd like someone to train the employees."
