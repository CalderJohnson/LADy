"Frankly, this is some of the worst sushi I've ever tried."
"Honestly, the worst sushi my husband and I had in our entire lives."
I'm not sure why this restaurant would be rated so highly.
The all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely of very poor quality.
limited menu no so fresh i ingredients thinly sliced fish fall apart r rice
"The only things you could really taste were the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice and the scallion on top of the fish."

The menu is limited but almost all dishes are excellent.
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great.
The service is good and the atmosphere is good for a date or a group outing.
The only drawback to this restaurant is the prices.
Even though it's good seafood the prices are too high.
The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.
The food was delicious (I had a special halibut my husband had steak and the service was top notch.
"When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me open my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occasion of some kind."
The mark of a careful waiter.
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.
We ate at this Thai place after the reviews but very unhappy with the food

"The food was very good, a lot, and the place itself was great."
"The wait staff is very friendly, they make it feel like you're eating in a friendly little European town."
"I like cafe noir don't get me wrong, it's just that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!"
"The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served."
The waitress seems more concerned with looking good than actually being a waitress.
"After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: where are you from... maybe you don't know how things work in America... and at the end stormed away almost tearfully screaming that tips are the only thing they survive on."
"We did tip, I guess the model/servant just wanted more and complained to the manager."
The whole setup is really unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff because despite the current one this is a great place.
Pizza here is consistently good.
Salads are a delicious way to start the meal.
You should pass on the calamari.
The decor is charming.
The service is average.

"I've tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name."
"If the weather is nice, try to grab an outside table"
"The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often."
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable wait staff I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it.
"Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time, the waiters didn't rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed."
I highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top-grade caviar and fantastic service
nice family owned traditional restaurant
fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.
"I found the food to be outstanding, especially the salmon dish I had."
I also ordered the change mojito which was out of this world.
"My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the next day to try the dim sum which was good...not outstanding, but good."
We ate out in the back patio which is worth it as it's cool and the music is heard well there.
"Overall, excellent restaurant"
The food was good.
The place was nice and calm.
But the service was a little slow.
The buffet had a nice selection.
The food was average or above including some surprisingly tasty dishes
The service was also very good.
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries
"I'd recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food."
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!
"Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they didn't feel like finishing them."
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.
"This place is really trendy but they've forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant, the f food"
"The last two times I ordered from here my food was so spicy that I could barely eat it, and the spice was also away from the flavor of the dish."
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
If you want authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.
"We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food"
"The Pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I had never heard of before."
"The back garden seating area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden."
We had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic.
"My husband said he could have eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the French fries were the best he ever had."
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right.
Love the food.
It's the only place you can get delicious authentic Japanese comfort food
I've lived in New York for 5 years and this place has it all.
Great food good size m menu great service and a pretentious setting
"The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from lamb sausage sardines with biscuits large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had)."
I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in New York.
"the freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery"
The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
We are very particular about sushi and were both pleased with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special) crab dumplings assorted sashimi s sushi nd rolls two types of s sake and the banana tempura
Definitely a great place for a nice occasion or date.
Average to good Thai food but terrible delivery
A Thai restaurant without rice during dinner?
"The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and wet."
This is a wonderful place on all points of view especially value of money.
An excellent service
The waiter was very kind and cordial and greeted us promptly.
She was very helpful in suggesting drinks and helped us order a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.
We ended our great experience by having gulab jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.
I thanked my friend who recommended this restaurant to me and will certainly recommend it to others.
"The service here was great, the food was fantastic."
"Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't like the fries that came with it, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared."
You can't go wrong with this place.
"The food is excellent and the service is quick, friendly and very professional."
Always a nice crowd but never loud.
I'm reluctant to write because I wouldn't want my jam of a pizza place to get overcrowded.
"By far, the best pizza in Manhattan."
"The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly."
The menu has so many fish items and oysters.
"The fish was really, really fresh."
We all agreed that Mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York.
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood.
All the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza.
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to return.
"Right after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are out of here."
For people who want great food plus great service Roxy is a place to avoid!
"The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland."
"The blonde wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great."
Mizu is the Japanese find in grammar.
"While their kitchen food is delicious, their sushi is out of this world."
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls to find nowhere else.
"Not only is the cuisine the best around, the service has always been attentive and charming."
Warning: you may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu
"Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match."
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor.
"The food was bland and small, dessert was not inspired."
I expected a little more from such a expensive menu
"The view is spectacular, and the food is great."
Wonderful strawberry daikyris as well!
authentic Taiwanese food that's cheap... what more could you ask for?
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan.
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere
"kind, attentive wait staff"
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto yum!).
My friend ate her chicken and potatoes.
Delicious crab cakes too.
"Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax."
Great neighborhood joint
This is a nice pizza place with a good selection of thin crust pizza including the basil slice
"Their calzones are horrible, bad, vomiting-inducing, yuck."
The counter service is bad.
No pizza 33 for me!
"The doses are sparse, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these."
"The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced."
"Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these people offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with useless clerks there was a shortage of the former too."
"Seriously, this place is a mess."
"The atmosphere is unprecedented, the service unprecedented, and the food magnificent."
"Best Italian food I ever had (and being Italian, that means a lot)."
"This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside."
The restaurant overlooks beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.
"The food is good, especially their more basic dishes and the drinks are delicious."
"This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset."
A great sushi experience.
Other than those of heading No.
Try the sushimi cucumber roll.
Good spreads great B beverage selections and bagels really tasty.
But who says Murray's is anything about service
The service is awful.
This place is not worth the price.
I love pizza 33 .
I'm going out with friends and all of a sudden I'm hungry and I only crave one thing... their pizza
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising.
The pizza is delicious and the owner is one of the nicest in New York.
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee !
"Bagels are fine, but be sure not to make any special requests!"
I asked for a cheese sandwich with an open face and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
Make sure you don 't get anything other than bagels ..
The turkey burgers are scary!
The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.
The sushi was terrible!
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so bad it was hard.
"Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting."
"The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced."
It's obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea or experience with Japanese cuisine.
"Good, fast service"
Food is great and cheap.
The location is perfect.
"Well, this place is so ghetto it's not even funny."
If you like your music blown up and the system isn't that great and if you want to pay at least $100 bottle minimum then you'll love it here.
A lovely pizza especially the margarita slice
Great atmosphere and worth every bit.
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.
The food is reliable and the price is moderate.
For authentic Thai food look no further than toons.
Try the pad Thai or sample anything on the appetizer menu.
Everything about this restaurant was special.
"The service was attentive, yet discreet."
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.
The place was quiet and delightful.
The service was good and the food is wonderful.
I didn't try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad (they're all good)
It's definitely a good place for snacks and chat.
"As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the past year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city."
"The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way)."
"The food is delicious, especially their perfectly cooked mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries"
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere delightfully free of the BTS.
You can get a totally delicious martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the vanilla shanty mmmm!) in a great homey's setting it great music
"The house-based lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests."
You can't go wrong with this place.
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
"Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is nearby and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again."
I love their Thai.
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must!
I'll be back to Suan soon!
In summer eating out on a terrace (another great feature of suan)!!!
I can't imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.
I can't imagine better Indian food in the whole city.
"In the last 3 months, the chef and staff have changed and it wasn't for the better."
The food is inconsistent now.
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.
The setting is casual and romantic.
The food is excellent!
"If you dare, try the balsamic vinegar over ice cream it's wonderful!"
Don't get the go go hamburgers no matter what the reviews say.
"The rest of the dim sum, though expensive by Chinatown standards, is worth it."
"The wait here is long for Dim Sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical noisy Dim Sum atmosphere isn't your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative."
A few tips: skip the turnip cake r roast pork buns and egg custards
The food was exceptional.
"I chose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine which was excellent."
The service was friendly and the atmosphere casual.
The restaurant is a little noisy but that's something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
This little place has a cute interior decoration and affordable city prices.
"The pad se ew chicken was delicious, however the pad thai was far too oily."
"I've eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good."
The fried dumplings are great!
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant
This place would be so much better served if run by a group that actually understands customer service
"terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut down."
Delicious bagels especially when straight out of the oven.
Spreads and toppings are great - though a little expensive.
Service is fast and friendly.
"The food is decent at best, and the atmosphere well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying."
"Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special."
"But after last night, Spices Grill is the only place I'm eating Indian cuisine"
You must try the shrimp appetizers
This place has the right atmosphere and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.
Great food great prices great service
"If you're looking for good quality, cheap meals - this is the place."
It's a perfect place to have a lovely Indian food
I really loved the different and innovative touch that the chef gives to the food.
It's also great to have dinner in a very romantic and comfortable place the service is just perfect... they're so friendly that we never want to live there!
"Their bagels are fine, but they're a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience."
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.
The service is slow and they don't toast!
The food was absolutely amazing!!
The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we ever had!!
"The lamb was tender and full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!"
The waiter was attentive.
The place itself is beautiful.
"Downtown dinner 2002 - prize fix: appetizers were ok, waiter gave me a poor suggestion.. try the potato stuff Kanish best one."
I had salmon (wasn't impressed) girlfriend had chicken it was good.
dessert is a joke...don't bother
"Virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly."
The restaurant has a family feeling not least with regard to the huge portions; the calf alone could have solved the Third World famine alone.
"The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari as were the filling p pasta mains"
the wine list is extensive and can easily be picked up for a meal otherwise reasonably priced
"Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquors which were courtesy of the house..."
It's a fantastic place.
Lucky strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.
Great food great d decor great service
"This is the perfect place to meet friends, have lunch, dinner, pre-theater or after-theater drinks!"
(Always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer !!
A great place for a vacation to get together with coworkers or friends you haven't seen in a while.
I've been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I've never been disappointed!
What a great place.
Not the typical New York gimmick theme restaurant
A cool bar with great food and tons of excellent beer
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
"If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona"
The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service
The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.
A cozy romantic atmosphere with only about 15 tables at most.
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.
"The food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world."
Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.
"The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle"
But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I've ever had.
I really liked this place.
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city.
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge)
It's definitely not a place to go if you want to impress someone.
"However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor you can't beat this place."
Fast and friendly service
"When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling you'd never know there was a world outside."
"The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly."
"I can't wait for summer, when they serve outdoors on their giant patio"
I tried Suan recently and I thought it was great.
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
Good food
Good drink .
I've never had a cheesecake like this.
Great spot whether you're looking for a couple drinks or a quiet dinner.
warm and friendly in winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.
The food is great and they have a good selection of wines at reasonable prices.
"While the atmosphere and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been much better."
"We ordered the chicken casserole but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone."
"I've been to Sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good."
stick with the chicken b beef and lamb dishes
"The service is friendly, and I never had a problem walking in and getting a table."
skip dessert
The best Rubin sandwich ever!
Don't miss Bloom's on your next trip to Manhattan.
"It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York."
Thanks for a lovely trip.
"The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily."
The pizza was a little wet.
Ravioli was good... but I have to say I found everything a little overpriced.
Not enough wine by the glass either.
"However, the service was excellent... and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot."
"Food was just average... if they lowered the prices just a little, it would be a bigger draw."
This place is a great deal.
authentic Pakistani food
People are always friendly.
don't waste money on decor
"Just straight up cheap, good food"
Fann is so good.
The best pad thai I've ever had.
The design and atmosphere are just as good.
bottles of wine are cheap and good.
The food was actually awe-inspiring.
"The mussels were the most fishy things I've ever tasted, the sea bass was bland, the goat cheese salad missed the goat cheese, the penny w/ chicken had bones in it... it was disgusting."
The service was very pleasant and the desert was good.
The jukebox plays everything from Italian opera to the strokes.
"The food is amazing, rich pasta and fresh doughy pizza"
"Best of all, the owner's warm vibe is super friendly and service is fast."
Come here for the drinks
The drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm.
"Ask for Usha, the nicest bartender in Manhattan."
My favorite was the Sassy lassi ..
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls
I really recommend the very simple unda rolls.
delicate spices o onion eggs and a kick-ass roti
"Toons has been recently remodeled, so it's now a very attractive space."
The food is as good as ever.
In an area that sadly lacks decent Thai food this is one of the best spots.
I went here last night - nice decor good service but the food was surprisingly excellent.
"The portions are huge, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and appetizer per person) for two people."
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!
Beef noodle soup is good too.
The service is good and the restaurant is clean.
The best Taiwanese food in New York!
I've been to Rao's probably 15 times in the last 3 years and it keeps getting better.
Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in New York.
My roommate and I love this place.
"We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating perfect since I had my Yorkie with me."
The indoor was very cozy and cute.
"The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good."
The staff is very accommodating.
"excellent dumplings served in a clean, chic decor"
"I got the $10 10-piece Dim Sum combo, every bite of which was great."
The decor is very simple but comfortable.
The food was delicious but don't come here on an empty stomach.
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
You must have the crab meat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
Great Indian food and the service is incredible.
The owner really caters to all your needs.
Great food and the prices are very reasonable.
The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh a delicious and sweet tasting bread.
Just some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices...
Service is not what you're coming here for...
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach.
"Whoever the jazz duo was, they were on point."
Good music great f food fast service affordable prices.
Even the wine by the glass was good.
consistently good Japanese tapas
Always good drinks and service is pretty good;
The atmosphere is nice and relaxed too...
A great place to meet for some food and drinks...
Yakitori (bbq meats) is tasty too.
If you don't mind pre-cut low-quality fish unfriendly staff and a sushi chef who looks like he's miserable then this is your place.
The price and quality of the fish alone will prevent us from making a return visit.
I wasn't going to share but I feel obliged... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.
"This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!"
"fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food cheap, generally friendly staffs and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very soho/village/upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Rosevelt Avenue!"
We were sitting outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on me and my date.
"One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter who wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so."
"With so many good restaurants on the UWs, I don't need overpriced food absurdly arrogant W waiters Ho don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service and M management hat doesn't care."
I'm relatively new to the area and tried picking a Bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overrated and on the expensive side.
The food is fine and the prices here are mediocre.
Baluchi's has solid food and nice decor at reasonable prices.
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.
He offers inferior service and has no personality.
There is no excuse for such a lousy service
I've never eaten 40 pieces of a relatively good nigiri before.
$20 for all you can eat sushi can't be beat.
"I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there."
"Most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive."
"The atmosphere is very relaxed and cozy, the service was great and the food was excellent!"
The food was good and the view of New York City skyline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.
Although they do the typical what kind of water you would like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.
The food is great.
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.
There's a downside if you're ordering in-- the delivery guys have a major attitude.
I've never had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of buffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walk-up) who always seem disappointed with their tips.
"Love the scene first off the place has a character and nice light to it.. very lucky, location wise."
The pizza was pretty good and huge.
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was a tremendously gigantic portion... a bucket of food literally.
"The pasta penny was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big job to dig... tasty at first but I would say I was full with a slice of pizza and seven to count, penny... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed... lol"
"La Rosa walks in, and I think they're doing it the best."
"Interesting selection of good wines, fun decor"
"I found it on a cold night, the perfect place to warm up."
I received prompt service with a smile.
This place blew me away... by far my new favorite restaurant on the Upper East Side.
The wine list is extensive and impressive.
I love the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris.
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert... definitely going to be back very soon.
I've been coming here for years and I have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.
"Over the years the host, Vitorio and his crew have always treated me like family-- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it's amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor."
I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the last few years: a new jazz bar the most fantastic dining garden the best th thin crust pizzas and now a lasagna menu hich is to die for (these aren't your average lasagnas)!
I love this place.
I must say I've never had a disappointing meal here.
We could have made a meal of the delicious dumplings from the dumpling menu.
Fortunately we saved room for the BBQ salmon's sea bass and crispy duck
I love you .
I recommend this place to everyone.
Great food
"The pasta is incredible, the risottos (especially the sepia are fantastic and the b braised rabbit is amazing."
The food here was mediocre at best.
It was totally overpriced - fish and chips was about $15....
tasty dog
A terrific organic dog and a conscious eco-friendly establishment
The Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it.
But the best pork souvlaki I ever had is the main thing.
Super delicious pizza
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant
I love their eggplant pizza as well as their pasta.
"We had half a pizza, mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was so huge for a small size pizza!"
Excellent food though the interior would need some help.
"space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting, without it trying to be that."
I paid about $ 60 for a good meal though :)
Great sake .
"reliable, fresh sushi"
The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious.
I've never had a problem with service except for a missing rice once.
delivery may be on-site or not depending on the weather and the day of the week.
Delivery guy gets upset sometimes if you don't tip more than 10%.
The best sushi ever.
This place ruined me for neighborhood sushi
Excellent sashimi and the M Millennium rolls are beyond delicious.
"The place is a little hidden away, but once you get there, it's all worth it."
Not only is the food
"The waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great."
Great place to relax and enjoy your dinner
There's something about their atmosphere that makes me come back almost every week.
"The place is open till late, no dress code."
Good food my favorite is seafood spaghetti
excellent food for great prices
The wait staff is very courteous and accommodating.
"space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour, but be richly rewarded when you taste the delicious Indo-Chinese food"
My favorite place lol
I love their chicken pasta I can't remember the name but it's sooo good
I'm not necessarily a fanatic about this place but it was a fun time for low-picks.
"Lobster was good, nothing spectacular."
"It's just a fun place to go, not a five-star resort."
I think the pizza is so overrated and was undercooked.
I had no taste and the staff is rude and not attentive.
I love this place.
The service was quick and friendly.
I thought the restaurant was nice and clean.
I ordered the Vittello alla Marsala and I was pretty impressed.
The veal and mushrooms were perfectly cooked.
The potato balls weren't dry at all... in fact they were buttery.
Worst place on Smith Street in Brooklyn
"Very immature bartender didn't know how to make specific drinks, the service was so slow, the food wasn't fresh or warm, waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and weren't very attentive to all the customers."
I would never recommend this place to anyone even for a casual dinner.
The food is always fresh ...
Japanese food overpriced with mediocre service
Chicken teriyaki had tomatoes or pimentos on top?
The food was lukewarm.
The waitress wasn't paying attention at all.
I was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they don't have it.
"Not because you're ""the four seasons""... you're allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romantic dinner."
"The food was excellent and the service was excellent, but I left the four seasons disappointed."
"I don't think dinner in Manhattan should cost $400,000 where I'm not swept off my feet."
"red dragon roll - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down"
Just go to Yamato and order the red dragon roll
The dynamite of seafood is also of another world.
My favorite sushi in NYC
"a pretentious spot on a park slope, the sushi is consistently good, the service is pleasant, effective and modest."
"In the summer months, the back garden area is really nice."
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves more inventive yet delicious Japanese food
"The dance, the white river and the millennium rolls are must."
I can eat here every day of the week really lol love this place ...)
The food is gross.
I can't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York.
My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year-old without any sense of proportion or flavor.
And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole
Don't get me started on the margaritas either.
"Oh, and I never write reviews-- I was just so moved by how bad this place was, I felt it was my duty to spread the word."
Great Indian food
"The food was good, the place was clean and affordable."
I noticed a lot of Indian people eating there which is a great sign for an Indian place
"This is one of my favorite places, very relaxing the food is great all the time, celebrated my engagement and my wedding here, it was very well organized."
The staff is very good.
I love their drink menu.
I highly recommend this beautiful place
We were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $8 a piece.
The food was okay.
Nice view of the river and NYC
Great service .
A beautifully designed dreamlike Egyptian restaurant that gets scenic at night.
Watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that's more lemon than smoky.
"Oh, and there's hookah"
Raymond the bartender rocks!
Pacifico is a great place to hang out casually.
"The drinks are great, especially when made by Raymond."
The brunch omelette is great...
"The spinach is fresh, definitely not frozen..."
"Quacamole at Pacifico is delicious, as are the wings with chimmichuri."
A weakness is the chicken in the salads
"Also, I personally wasn't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole"
"In general, decent food at a good price, with friendly people"
Best Indian restaurant in the city
The decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing!
This little Astoria Souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.
"What really makes it shine is the food that is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the g gyro meat and sausages, and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected."
"All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come-- if you don't eat one your trip was wasted."
The best restaurant in Brooklyn
Great food amazing's service this place is a class act.
The calf was incredible last night.
This place is a must visit!
Most booths allow you to sit next to each other without looking like that couple.
The food is all shared so we can order together and eat together.
My daughter's wedding reception at the water's edge received the highest compliments from our guests.
Everyone was delighted with the atmosphere (elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views and the fabulous food
The service was wonderful .
"Paul the Maitre D, was totally professional and always on top of things."
Thank you all at the water's edge
"Okay, but unfriendly, filthy bathroom."
"The high prices you're going to pay are for the view, not for the food."
"The drinks at the bar were, uh, okay to say the least."
The stuff tilapia was horrible... tasted like cardboard.
"We thought the dessert would be better, wrong!"
"Oh, speaking of bathroom, the men's bathroom was disgusting."
The wine list was extensive - although the staff did not seem to know about wine pairing.
"the bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ""free"" appetizer of olives was disappointing."
"However, our main course was wonderful."
I had fish and my husband had filed - both of which exceeded our expectations.
"The dessert (we had a pear cake was good - but, again, the staff as unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions."
When we asked about ports - the waitress listed several but did not know taste variations or cost.
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location
"In all, I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future."
"Short and sweet seating is great: it's romantic, cozy and private."
Both aren't as small as some of the reviews make them look like they're perfect for 2 people.
The service was extremely fast and attentive thanks to the service button on your table) but I barely understood a word when the waiter took our order.
The food was okay and fair nothing to go crazy about.
The whole place looks more than the actual meals .
So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food
subtle food and service
Noodle pudding is exactly the kind of service and food I enjoy.
"Servers are all different, Greg is my favorite."
"Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a server who has personality, professionalism, and respects the privacy of your dinner."
This is the first time I've been that a runner remembers my order... hoping he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant.
prices are fair in all respects for both food and beverage
"I go out to eat and like my courses, the servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink."
Amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings !!
This place had all the trimming and I mean all of it.
Amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out!!!!
Stepping into Casa La Femme last night was a real experience unlike any other in New York!
Very impressed with the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had!
They have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that's to die for!
"Food took some time to prepare, all worth waiting for."
We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd.
I never write on these sites but this restaurant is definitely worth praising!
worm in food
"The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average."
"Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a worm in mushroom sauce at the bottom."
I showed it to the manager and he smiled and apologized and brought us two free desserts (but didn't ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).
"The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession."
"I've worked in restaurants and cooked a lot, and there's no way a worm should be able to get into well-prepared food"
"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service"
I got hair in my food twice since then !
Great place great value.
"the food is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably priced."
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.
It's a great place to order from or sit in.
The sushi experience was incredible with my fiancée.
Good creative rolls
"Yamato is an excellent place to go if you're not into sashimi, or if you have friends who don't like sushi much."
They have great rolls the triple color t and Norwegian rolls are awesome and filling.
"One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert"
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert as well as a great g green tea tempura
The appetizers are delicious too!
amazing food
cleaning of the interior
Great food
I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers.
"The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a little lack, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors"
Despite the confusing mirrors this will probably be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future.
Indo-Chinese food is pretty good...
A very fancy place but not very good Chinese style Indian food
"The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the dishes (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, especially the chicken chili"
"My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the food can be a little over the top spicy and far too oily."
I was speechless by the horrible food
"I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was very disappointing."
"Instead of preparing vegetarian dishes, the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation)."
This place survives on reputation alone.
"This is the most wonderful restaurant in all of New York City, not just Brooklyn..."
"For 7 years they have put out the most tasty, most delicious food and kept it that way..."
"Never swinging, never a bad meal, never bad service."
Great food great wines list great service in a great neighborhood ..
Patsy's pizza = true love
Hands down the best pizza on the planet.
Great hot dogs .
The hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside.
Great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a midday boost!
"For me, dishes are a little oily, but overall dining experience is good."
Helpful service and average price per dish $10.
The only thing that strikes you is the decor (not very pleasant).
Great food
This place has great Indian Chinese food
"Be prepared to wait, because the place is pretty tiny."
"Even though the place isn't beautiful, the food speaks for itself."
"The best Indian Chinese in the city, by far!"
"I came across the village underground by accident, now I go there all the time."
The Martinis are amazing and very fairly priced.
"The service is amazing, I've had different waiters and they were all nice, which is a rare thing in NYC."
"The DJ is awesome, I've been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep coming back."
Everything on the menu is great.
This establishment is the real deal.
"I wish New York had more of these places: intimate, superb food homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait."
But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include wine?
"Look, the appetizers were really good."
The entree was also very good.
What you're paying for is the environment and the name.
"Yeah, the place is classy and beautiful, but they certainly target the Uber Whealthy not the common Joe who wants to go all out every once in a while."
Vanison was good but not amazing.
Bison was pretty excellent though.
The dessert is a pure disaster.
"I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself, but maybe it's worth it."
"The Four Seasons has history and it's a kind of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they'll charge you through the nose just so you can say ""I've been to the Four Seasons restaurant""."
"All in all, the food was great (except for the desserts."
The environment is very upscale and you'll see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.
If you're going for the food it won't be worth it.
"You'd think they'd make up for it with service sadly, no."
"The service was fine, it's not what you'd expect for $500."
I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!
I literally just got home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit I felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.
We arrived late for our reservation so I can't complain too much about waiting for a table.
This place is beautiful!
The hostess was very pleasant.
"However, our $14 drinks were horrible!"
We also asked for hookah six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returned with the hookah.
After the fourth time I asked again and the waiter said after our dinner.
We asked for sides which the waiter then admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.
My chicken was inedible because there were so many fat lumps that I had to keep spitting out into my napkin.
I wouldn't expect this for a $55 dinner.
"By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see after our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we could enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!"
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was uneatable!
"I've never left a restaurant feeling like I was abused, and wasted my hard earned money."
The menu is pretty simple without much description.
"There was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment."
"Not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with Brahma."
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (perhaps 3 of each).
"The lobster knuckles were okay, but pretty tasteless."
"I believe there were 2 shrimps in the ""salted encrusted shrimp"" appetizer"
I had the Thai-style fried sea bass..which was very good.
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food except my brother who had the G-grilled mahi mahi seemingly soaked in grapefruit juice!
I heard the lobster roll was excellent.
"All the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh."
"service not the most friendly to our ""big party""!"
Great Indian food
"Indian food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had."
"""very normal Indian food, but done really well."
"I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at an upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel"
"Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggesting things as if they're complimentary when they actually cost $$."
"But if you're willing to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food"
"The slogan says it all... ""Indian spice rave"""
The lunch buffet is expensive but it's worth it.
We've only been to dinner a few times but the same quality and service is provided.
Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in New York
I've never been so disgusted by both food and service.
"However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchi before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a much more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin."
"My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent to me and others, but I would be lying if I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort from the restaurant to correct the situation."
"My girlfriend, being a little more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the rest of her barely eaten meal called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant."
"It wasn't like this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's just repulsive."
A beautiful place ideal for a romantic dinner.
I booked a gorgeous white organza tent that included a four course prize fix menu which we enjoyed a lot.
The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!
I would recommend Casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date.
"The bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling."
Too bad I paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.
The nakgi-bokum was horrible.
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted.
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.
"The side dishes were passable, and I did get a refill on request."
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish
The wife had the risotto which was amazing.
The Farro salad and the Yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.
I love margarita pizza I love east village pizza
love this place every time we're in the city this is one of the places we always go.
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza
"The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really enhances the flavor of all the other components."
"Personally, I like the Margarita pizza better, but they're all good."
Probably the most romantic restaurant in the city.
"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (which does not serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!"
Not only is it an adventure to get to this somewhat hidden place once you enter the unmarked wooden doors the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you are no longer in the city.
"If you plan to come here, make sure your date is someone you really like since you will be led to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose those on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you can see the stars in the sky!)."
It's just you and your date and an occasional cute excuse before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!
My party had the $29 fixed price menu which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!
We started with a delicious sashimi amuse bouche
"I picked the grilled black cod as my starter, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better."
The sake has complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.
"For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake which was phenomenal."
"Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philadelphia yes, it wasn't a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can't say enough good things about this brasserie"
"I don't usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I'll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner."
"The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you're rushed to the place your order is, to being ignored the rest of the night."
"They're extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks and their pita bread"
great shabu shabu
I tried a couple of other dishes but wasn't too impressed.
But for the shabu shabu you won't find much better in New York.
"The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and the service is good too."
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos
"The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to come here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich perfect on its supermarket squishy b bun"
restaurant with a view
The food tasted very good.
The family seafood snack was very good.
The main menu was also very good.
"The price is high but the food is good, so I'd come back again."
This place doesn't make any sense.
This place has totally weird decor stairs going up with mirrored walls I'm surprised how nobody yet broke their head or fell off the stairs mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
The concept of Japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
"The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked."
Good food
"The food was great and tasty, but the seating space was too small, I don't like being cramped in a corner."
It was a very nice romantic place .
A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it.
The atmosphere was great.
"The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about."
"Our waitress wasn't mean, but not particularly warm or attentive either."
"I must say I'm surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier this year, though."
"Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio"
The servers at flatbush farm seem to have perfected that horrible technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
"A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious)."
"Overall, the food quality was pretty good, although I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest."
"The place has a nice fit some attractive f furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)"
How is this palce still open?
Everything was going well until we got our meals
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.
"It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and potato purée."
"I've had one bite of the $24 salmon and I've never, in the 17 years I've been to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in flatbush farms."
"At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress walked away."
"So, I switched with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just couldn't bite through it."
"This is where it really gets really bad: the manager said, there's absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I can't comp it."
"The manager came to the table and said we could do what we wanted, so we paid for what we enjoyed, the drinks and appetizers and walked out."
This staff should be fired.
and other products of the same name
It was really good pizza.
The crust was amazingly well cooked and the pizza was fully loaded:):)
The worst single restaurant in Manhattan
I'll be with a couple of positives: cool decor good P pita and hummus and G grilled octopus hat was actually pretty tasty.
If I could give 0 stars I would do it for this place
This place... God where do I start?
It's quite a spectacular scene I'll give them that.
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just paid 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 fucking hours to come!!!!
"How this place survives the competitive West Village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me."
Great hot dogs
"Although it's been crowded most of the time I've been here, bark always delivers on their food"
"The hot dogs are top notch, and they're slamwich is amazing!"
"Going to bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!"
The only complaint is the pricing--I think it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu
But nevertheless... great spot great food
fabulous food - if the front of the house staff doesn't put you off 
"Every time we've been, the front of the house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet you and sit down) has been so horrible to us that if it wasn't for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return."
"Since BFC does not make reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of the house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!"
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/lady Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" with brown hair, who listens to your conversation and rings in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about."
"Considering you'll spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service"
"""Eat and get out"""
"The food and service were fine, however the maitre-d was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant."
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine our son's fiancée joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.
"This guy refused to sit her down and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant."
"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-d's sense of ""table turnover"", as crazy as it is, or else."
Best meal in a long time!
Muscles and calamari were superb Saturday night.
I had the lamb special which was perfect.
"My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish."
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.
The food is great and the environment is even better.
Taking hot dogs to the next level
"At first glance this place seems a little expensive for a hot dog joint, but at bark you don't just get your average hot dog"
Here the hot dog is raised to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.
Great atmosphere
I highly recommend the fish tacos everything else was okay.
cool atmosphere the fireplace in the back really advertises it but needs a little more heat throughout on a cold night.
poor service and management
Don't go to this place
I had a terrible experience at Casa la femme on a Saturday dinner.
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.
Can't believe how a expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its customers.
"The food is very good, but not outstanding."
"There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the waiting for a table."
"mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, maybe even a glass of wine... but not the grunt we received from the al di la staff"
"The bread was outdated, the salad was overpriced and empty."
"The pasta was well cooked, but it didn't have enough sauce or flavor."
The hostess was rude and I had a distinct feeling that they didn't want to serve us.
The only thing my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at me like I was crazy.
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""Can I help you?"" and ""How many are in your party?"""
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service
bad staff
I generally like this place.
The food is good.
The design of the space is good.
But the service is horrible!
"I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter"
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic garbage bag in one hand.
"The waitress came to check on us every few minutes, and started clearing the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it)."
"I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff"
