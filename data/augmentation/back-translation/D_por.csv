We were sitting outside and the waiter poured red wine and hot tea on me and my boyfriend.

"What really makes it shine is the food that is aggressively seasoned with cirpriot spices, and all made at home (even the meat and G-Giro sausages, and made of much higher quality ingredients that otherwise might be expected."
"All the Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the giraffe is the reason to come... if you don't eat one, the trip was wasted."
Best restaurant in Brooklyn
"Great food, great service, this place is a class act."
The meat was amazing last night.
This place is a must!
Most cabins let you sit next to each other without looking like a couple.
Food is shared so we can order and eat together.
My daughter's wedding reception on the waterfront received the highest praise from our guests.
Everyone was delighted with the atmosphere (elegant room and absolutely unparalleled view and fabulous food)
The service was wonderful .
Paul D. was totally professional and always on top of things.
Thank you to everyone at the water's edge.
"Great service, but it's not friendly, dirty bathroom."
"The high prices you're gonna pay are for the sight, not the food."
"The drinks at the bar were, at least, great."
The tilapia material was horrible... with a cardboard flavor.
"We thought dessert would be better, wrong!"
"Speaking of bathroom, men's bathroom was disgusting."
The list of wines was extensive - although the staff did not seem to be aware of the wine combinations.
"The bread we received was horrible - hard and cold - and the ""free"" olive oil snack was disappointing."
But our main course was wonderful.
I had fish and my husband had filet - both exceeded our expectations.
"The dessert (we have a pear cake was good - but, again, staff couldn't provide adequate drink suggestions."
"When we asked about ports, the waitress listed several, but she didn't know what the tastes or costs were."
It's not what I expected for the price and prestige of this place.
"I'd go back, generally, because it was a nice restaurant, but I hope the staff will pay more attention to the little details in the future."
"It's romantic, welcoming and private."
Both are not as small as some of the reviews make them seem perfect for two people.
"The service was extremely fast and attentive, thanks to the service button on your desk, but I barely understood a word when the waiter received our request."
"The food was good and fair, nothing to drive you crazy."

"So what really ends up paying is the restaurant, not the food."
Subtle food and services
The pasta pudding is exactly the kind of service and food I like.
"The servers are different, Greg is my favorite."
"Sometimes the tables don't understand your sense of humor, but it's refreshing to have a server who has personality, professionalism, and respect for the privacy of your dinner."
It's the first place a runner remembers my order... I hope he likes his work because I'm headed to steal it for my restaurant.
Prices are fair in all respects for both food and beverage
"I'm gonna eat and enjoy my courses, the servers are patient and I never rush courses or force another drink."
Amazing fresh dogs but the best of all are the infinite spoons !!
"This place had all the decorations, and I mean everything."
Amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out!!!!
Getting into the House of the Woman last night was a real experience unlike any other in New York!
"Very impressed with the decor, the food, the hospitality, and the great night I had!"
They have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lemon juice and mint leaves that's for dead!
"The food took some time to prepare, it's all worth the wait."
We were drawn to the belly dance show that captivated the crowd.
"I never write on these websites, but this restaurant is worth praising!"
Weight in food
"The menu was great and the employee was very nice, but when the food arrived, it was average."
"However, I finished the dish and that's when I found a worm in the mushroom sauce at the bottom."
"I showed it to the manager, and he smiled, apologized, and brought us two free desserts (but he didn't ask us what we wanted and brought the last two desserts we asked for)."
"The manager finally said that he would compose the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession."
"I've worked in restaurants and cooking a lot, and there's no way a worm should be able to get into well-prepared food"
"For a restaurant with a good reputation and that is usually so crowded, there was no reason for a lack of intelligent customer service"
I 've had hair on my food twice !
"Great place, great value."
"The food is tasty, plentiful and reasonably priced."
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.
It's a great place to ask or sit.
The sushi experience with my fiancé was amazing.
Good creative roles
"Yamato is a great place to go if you don't like sashimi, or if you have friends who don't like sushi very much."
They have great triple-color rolls and Norwegian rolls are amazing and filling.
"A special roll and a regular roll are enough to fill, but save room for dessert."
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert and a great green tea tempura.
The snacks are delicious too!
Amazing food
Inland waterway
Good food.
I've had my cut of modern Japanese and this place is good.
"The atmosphere was very good, but there was a little bit of a shortage, which he tries to compensate with a crazy mirror scheme."
"Despite the confusing mirrors, this will be my favorite for modern Japanese food in the future."
Indo-Chinese food is very good...
"A very elegant place , but not very good Chinese style Indian food"
"Chicken rabbit is my favorite, most dishes (I have to agree with an earlier reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, especially chicken chicken"
"My mother originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels that the food can be a little spicy and very oily."
I'm speechless because of the horrible food.
"I went to a vacation dinner at the restaurant, and the food was very disappointing."
"Instead of preparing a vegetarian dish, the chef offered me a dish of cooked vegetables (sausage, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation)."
This place only survives by reputation.
"This is the most wonderful restaurant in New York, not just in Brooklyn..."
"For seven years, they've been throwing out the most delicious and tasty food and keeping it like this..."
"Never a bad meal, never a bad service."
"Great food , great wine list , great service in a big neighborhood ."
Patsy's pizza is true love.
Deliver the best pizza on the planet.
Great hot dogs .
The hot dogs were juicy and tender on the inside and had a lot of crunch and snap on the outside.
"Great spoons, definitely a place to eat at night or a boost in the middle of the day!"
"I think the dishes are a little greasy, but the overall experience is good."
Useful service and average price per dish of $10.
The only thing that attracts you is the decoration.
Good food.
This place has great Indian Chinese food.
"Get ready to wait, because the place is too small."
"Even if the place isn't pretty, the food speaks for itself."
"The best Indian Chinese in town, by far!"
"I found the village subway by accident, now I go there all the time."
Martinis are incredible and very reasonable.
"The service is amazing, I've had different employees, and they've all been nice, which is rare in New York."
The DJ is fantastic. I've been there for my birthday and other times with friends and I keep coming back.
Everything on the menu is great.
This establishment is the real deal.
"I'd like to have more of these places: intimate, excellent food, home, first class, definitely worth waiting for."
But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include wine?
"Look, the snacks were really good."
The appetizer was very good too.
What you're paying for is the environment and the name.
"Yeah, the place is elegant and beautiful, but they certainly target the Uber Whealthy, not the average Joe who wants to go out every now and then."
"Vanison was good, but he wasn't amazing."
"The bison was pretty good, though."
Desert is a disaster.
"I read reviews that said the restaurant was too expensive, and I thought, maybe it's worth it."
"The four seasons have a history and it's kind of a New York restaurant landmark, but believe me, they charge you for the nose just so you can say, ""I went to the four seasons restaurant""."
"Overall, the food was great (except for desserts."
The atmosphere is very luxurious and you'll see many rich men with trophy wives or just well-paid escorts.
"If you're going to get the food, it's not worth it."
"I'd think they'd compensate for service, unfortunately not."
"The service was fine, not what you expected for $500."
I agree that dinner at Casa la Femme is like no other dining experience!
I just got home from visiting Casa La Femme and I felt so offended by my visit that I felt the need to try to warn other restaurants that value your money and time.
"We're late for the reservation, so I can't complain too much about waiting for a table."
This place is beautiful!
The hostess was very nice.
"However, our $14 drinks were horrible!"
We also ordered the hook six times and the waiter kept telling us for a minute and never came back with the hook.
After the fourth time I asked again and the waiter said after dinner.
We ask for the sides that the waiter admitted he forgot to put that part of our order.
"My chicken was edible, for there were so many fat grains that I had to keep spitting on the cloth."
I didn't expect this for a $55 dinner.
"When we left, our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see after dinner, which would have been acceptable if we could enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!"
"If it seemed possible to do that while I was there, I would have fought my account, since my dinner portion of my meal was indelible!"
I never left a restaurant feeling abused and wasting my money.
"The menu is pretty simple, with no description."
"There was no beer from the tap that night, which was a disappointment."
"It wasn't a big selection of bottled beer, either, we went with Brahma."
The snacks we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a small serving (maybe 3 each).
"Lobster knees were fine, but tasteless."
"I think there were two shrimp in the ""Cameroon salted shrimp"" appetizer."
"I ate Thai-style fried mares, which was really good."
"Everyone seemed happy with the food, except for my brother, who had mahi mahi grilled, apparently dipped in grape juice!"
I heard lobster roll was great.
"The food was good, a little expensive, but fresh."
"The service is not the most friendly for our ""big party""!"
Great Indian food
"I love Indian food and I eat it regularly, but I can say it's one of the best I've ever had."
"""a very normal Indian food, but very well made."
"I have a 4 instead of a 5 because of the price (only tick masala - no rice bread - is $25), which I would expect in a luxurious Indian restaurant, but this place doesn't have a luxurious feel"
"The employees also try to push you for more food, suggesting things like courtesy, when they actually cost $0."
"But if you're willing to spend some money and remember to ask if anything they offer is free, then this is the place to go for Indian food."
"The slogan says it all... ""Screw Indian spices""."
"The lunch buffet is expensive, but it's worth it."
"We've only been to dinner a few times, but the quality and service are the same."
Bukhara is in the top five of my Indian places in New York.
I've never been more disgusted with food and service.
"However, once I received my predictable and mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks is like a Korean fair (sometimes you have to calm down when it's your only option), I went through half my kimchi before finding a random piece of alfalfa accompanied by a much more disgusting, sticky, clearly bad piece of fish skin."
"My main concern was the health of the food that was being sent to me and to others, but I would lie, and I said that as someone who has been working in restaurants since I was 15, I expected at least a minimal effort from the restaurant to correct the situation."
"My girlfriend, who was a little more aggressive, and who was equally disgusted by making her throw out the rest of her badly eaten meal, called to inform me that I was probably wrong and that it was probably an oyster, and that we were also on the blacklist of their restaurant."
"It wasn't like this restaurant had big bounty points before, but now it's just disgusting."
A beautiful place ideal for a romantic dinner.
I booked a beautiful white organza tent that included a four-course menu that we really liked.
"The service was spectacular, the employee knew everything about the menu, and the recommendations were amazing!"
I would highly recommend Casa la Femme for any special occasion and to impress your date.
"The bi-bacon was medium, but the stone bowl was not even close to kicking."
Too bad I paid $2 more for the stone bowl.
Nakgi-bokum was horrible.
The worst fried squid I ever tasted.
The sauce tasted more Chinese fast food than decent Korean.
The side dishes were affordable and I got a refill on request.
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.
My wife had barely touched that messy plate.
"The woman had the risotto, which was amazing."
Farro salad and Yukon potato purée were also extremely tasty.
I love the pizza Margarita I love the pizza from the East Village
I love this place every time we're in town.
A slice of pizza from NYC
"The crust has a big bite and a good chewing, the sauce is light with a good acidity, the salt in the cheese is great, it really enhances the flavor of all the other ingredients."
"I personally like margarita pizza better, but they're all good."
Maybe the most romantic restaurant in town.
"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (which does not serve sushi), and, in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!"
"Not only is it an adventure to get to this somewhat hidden place when you walk into the unmarked wooden doors, Zen and the intimate decor will make you feel like you're no longer in town."
"If you're planning on coming here, make sure your date is someone you really like, as you'll be taken to private cabins where there will be no people or food to watch (choose those that are on the floor with glass roofs so you can see the stars in the sky!)."
It's just you and your boyfriend and a cute one every now and then.
"My group had the $29 fine price menu, which was a wonderful deal, since it also came with a sake flight!"
We started with a delicious sashimi amuse bouche
"I chose grilled black cod as my appetizer, which I absolutely ate while someone commented that grilled salmon dish was better."
Sake has done very well on courses and is successfully liberating me in the sake world.
"For desserts, we tried frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (green tea powder) and blueberry cheesecake which was phenomenal."
"Maybe it was the big company (I had friends visiting from Philadelphia Yes, it wasn't a meeting this time) or the super reasonable price, but I just can't say good enough things about this brasserie"
"I don't usually visit the same establishment more than once or twice, but I'll go to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, no-hurry, memorable dinner."
"The service leaves a lot to be desired, from feeling rushed to the place you asked for, to being ignored for the rest of the night."
"They're extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we've been given and giving us a bill well over $500 for a few drinks and their pita bread."
large shabu shabu
"I tried other dishes, but I wasn't very impressed."
"But for Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in New York."
"The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you have kimchi and a free salad with your meal and the service is good too."
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pig belly sticks.
"Hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason you're here is the fantastic perfect pork croquet sandwich at your b-boon supermarket."
Restaurant with a view
The food was really good.
The family's seafood snack was really good.
The main course was also very good.
"The price is high, but the food is good, so I'd come back."
This place doesn't make sense.
This place has totally weird decorative stairs climbing up with mirrored walls.
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
The Japanese tapas concept is new and clearly not working.
"The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing, and not cooked."
Good food
"The food was great and tasty, but the living room was too small, I don't like cramps in a corner."
It was a very romantic place .
Me and a colleague tried the Pacific after work a few Fridays and we loved it.
The atmosphere was great.
"The food we ordered was excellent, although it doesn't say that margaritas are something to write home about."
"Our maid was not bad, but not too warm or attentive."
"I must say, I'm surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier this year."
"We're back, and we can't wait to visit in the summer to enjoy the yard."
The Flatbush Farm servers seem to have perfected this horrible technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for enjoying their attention.
"A different server added to the fun, throwing our plates in front of us, halfway to our appetizer (which was delicious)."
"Overall, the quality of the food was good, although I've heard that salmon is much better when it doesn't cool down in front of the guest."
"The place has good equipment, some attractive furniture and, as far as I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I got the menu when I ordered the carte des vins)"
How come this place is still open?
Everything was going well until we had our meals.
I only looked at the chicken once and I was horrified.
"Served with leather, on a bed of extremely uncooked spinach and potato purée."
"I've eaten a 24-dollar salmon and in the 17 years I've been in restaurants, I've never tasted a salmon as fishy, as dry, as soft as that of a flatbush farm."
"At this point, the maid comes in and asks if everything's okay, I was literally so shocked I didn't say anything and guess what, the maid left."
"So I switched with my boyfriend again to see if maybe he could digest the meat and the thorns again, but the thorns were so badly cooked I couldn't bite."
"This is where it really gets bad: the manager said there's absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like, and I can't make up for it."
"The manager came to the table and said we can do whatever we want, so we pay for whatever we like, drinks and snacks and we go out."
These people should be fired.
Beer crust circle
It was a really good pizza.
The crust was incredibly well cooked and the pizza was fully loaded:):)
The worst restaurant in Manhattan
"I'll be on the positive side: nice decoration, good pita and hummus and G. Grilled chicken hat was really delicious."
If I could give it zero stars I would do it for this place
"This place... God, where do I start?"
It's a pretty spectacular scene.
"The decor, however, seems to be the distraction so you don't realize that you just paid $300 for a cold berinjela that took 2 hours to come!!!!"
"How this place survives the competitive market of the West Village in this economy, or any other, is beyond me."
Big hot dogs
"Although it's been crowded most of the time I've been here, barking always delivers its food."
"Hot dogs are top notch, and the slamwich is amazing!"
Laughing is always worth the train and will make your tongue and stomach very happy!
The only complaint is the price - I think it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less for each item listed on the menu
"But still, a good place and good food."
fabulous food - if the team in front of the house doesn 't get away .
"Every time we've been there, the front-house staff (not the employees - they're great - but the people who greet you and sit down) has been so horrible to us that if it wasn't for the exceptional fish dishes, I would never come back."
"Since BFC does not make reservations, you almost always have to wait at the bar - and be abused by the people in front of the house until you sit down, which can be more than an hour later!"
The retro frzzy girl will yell at you if you try to order a drink.
I'd be horrified if my team rejected clients so soon and so grossly!
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" with brown hair, she listens to your conversation and rings the bell, except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're talking about."
"Considering you're spending at least $60 a head, I expect better service."
"""Eat and get out"""
"The food and service were fine, but the master-d was incredibly uncomfortable and arrogant."
"As we were finishing our meals, which included a luxurious bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert."
"This guy refused to sit her down and she left, followed by the four of us, but not before telling her that in 40 years of traveling the world, including Paris, she had never seen a frontman with such bad behavior in a restaurant."
"One word for the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the master's sense of ""round the table"", as sloppy as it is, or whatever."
Best meal in a long time!
The sauces and squid were great on Saturday night.
I had the lamb special that was perfect.
"My dad had the side steak, which was really good, and my mom had the swordfish."
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.
The food is great and the atmosphere is even better.
Take hot dogs to the next level
"At first glance, this place looks a little expensive for a hot dog joint, but shaving doesn't just get your average hot dog."
Here the hot dog is raised to the level of a real appetizer with numerous variations available.
Great atmosphere .
I highly recommend fish tacos.
"The cool atmosphere of the stove at the bottom is great, but it needs a little more heat on a cold night."
Insufficient service and management
Don't go to this place.
I had a horrible experience at the Casa la Femme at a Saturday dinner.
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely badly.
I can't believe an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its customers.
"The food is very good, but it's not exceptional."
"There's no way to justify the praise you get, the attitude of the staff or waiting for a table."
"Mistakes happen, but they're usually accompanied by an apology, maybe even a glass of wine, but not the scream we get from the Al Di La staff."
"The bread was old, the salad was too expensive and empty."
"The dough was well cooked, it had no sauce or flavor."
"The hostess was rude, and I had a clear feeling they didn't want to serve us."
"The only thing my friend left out was that when we sat down at the bar, the bartender disappeared."
I ordered a menu and the same maid looked at me like I was crazy.
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""I can help you"" and ""How many people are at your party?"""
Shame on this place for the horrible rude and non-existent customer service staff
Bad team
I like this place.
The food is good.
The design of the space is good.
But the service is horrible!
"I was there for lunch recently, and we were accompanied by a waiter and a waiter"
"The servant delivered the food, holding in one hand what appeared to be a plastic garbage bag."
"The waitress would check on us every few minutes and start cleaning the dishes while half of us were still eating (a big, all-out cocktail, so I try to ignore it)."
"I wish I liked this place better, and I wish someone would coach the team."
