"Sometimes the tables don't understand his sense of humor, but it's exciting to have a host who respects your personality, professionalism and the privacy of your food."
"This is the first time a runner remembers my order, and I hope he likes it because I'm halfway through my mind stealing it for my restaurant."
Food and beverage prices are fair on all sides
"I go out to dinner and I like my classes, the teachers are patient and never rush the classes."
Fresh dogs but the best are endless topping !
"This place had all the decorations, and I mean all of them."
Great fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out!!!!
Last night at Casa la femme was a real experience like no other in New York!
"I was so impressed with the decor, the hospitality, and the great nights!"
"Let's have a great cocktail with citrus vodka, lemon juice and leafy corn."
"It took a while to prepare, it was all worth the wait."
We were drawn to a crowd-pleasing belly dance show.
"I never write on these sites, but this restaurant is commendable!"
Worms in the food
"The menu looked great, the waiter was nice, but when it came to food, it was average."
"Still, I finished my plate and finally found a worm in mushroom sauce."
I showed the manager and he smiled and apologized and brought us two free candy (but he didn 't ask what we wanted and he brought us the last two candy we wanted).
"Finally, the manager said that he would buy two glasses of wine (which was less expensive than the meal) and it seemed like a great gift."
"I worked in restaurants and cooked a lot of food, so it's impossible for a pig to get into a well-cooked meal."
"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and often so crowded, there was no reason for intelligent customer service to be so short."
"Since then , I 've had hair twice in my meals !"
"It's a great place, a great value."
"The food is delicious, plentiful and reasonably priced."
It's a comfortable atmosphere.
It's a great place to order or sit.
My sushi experience with my fiancee was amazing.
Creative roles
"If you don't like sushi or if you have friends who don't like sushi, Yamato is the perfect place to go."
"There are three great T-colored rolls, and Norwegian rolls are great and satisfying."
"A special and regular roll is enough to fill you up, but make room for the sweet"
They have a delicious banana chocolate sweet and a wonderful green tea tempura
The explanations are delicious!
Great food .
interior
Good food .
I've been listening to modern Japanese and this place is great.
"The atmosphere was pretty good, but it was a little short, so he's trying to make up for it with a crazy pattern."
"Despite the mixing mirrors, this will be my favorite place for modern Japanese food in the near future."
Indian Chinese food is pretty good...
"It's a nice place, but not a very good Chinese-style Indian meal."
"Chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the food (I agree with an earlier critic) is quite oily and very spicy, especially chicken chicken."
"My mother introduced me to this place, but even she thinks that food can be a little too spicy and too greasy."
I couldn't talk because of the terrible food.
I went to a vacation dinner at the restaurant and the meal was very disappointing.
"Instead of eating vegetables, the chef gave me a plate of steamed vegetables (less sauce, spices, or any shape or aesthetic presentation)."
This place only survives by its reputation.
"This is the greatest restaurant in New York, not just Brooklyn..."
"They've been taking out the best, the best food for seven years and keeping it like this."
"Never be shaken, there's never bad food, there's never bad service."
"Great food , great wine , great service in a great neighborhood ."
Patsy's Pizza is true love.
Deliver the best pizza in the world.
Great hot dogs .
Hot dogs were so cute and kind on the inside and there was so much grin and cracking out there.
Great topping is definitely a place to check out for late-night dining or a daytime increase!
"The food is a little greasy for me, but overall the experience is good."
The average cost for a meal and a service is $10.
The only thing that impresses you is the decor .
Good food .
There's great Indian Chinese food here.
"Be ready to wait, because the space is quite small."
"It's not nice here, but the food speaks for itself."
"The best Indian Chinaman in town, by far!"
"I ran into an underground village in town, and now I go there all the time."
Martini's are incredible and very affordable.
"The service was amazing, there were different waiters, and they were all nice, which is rare in NYC."
"DJ's great, I was there for my birthday and I've been there with my friends a lot."
Everything on the menu is great.
This organization is real.
"I wish there were more places like this: close, great food, upscale homes, definitely worth the wait."
But $500 for a dinner for two without wine?
"Look, the flashbacks were really nice."
The food was great.
What you pay for is the environment and the name.
"Yeah, it's stylish and nice, but it's definitely not Uber Whealthy, the average Joe who wants to go out every now and then."
"Vanison was good, but not surprising."
The bison was pretty perfect.
"It's a sweet, pure disaster."
I read the comments that said the restaurant was too expensive and I thought maybe it was worth it.
"It's four seasons old and it's a symbol of New York City restaurants, but believe me, they're gonna pay you right up your ass to say, ""I went to a restaurant for four seasons""."
Everything was fine (except the hard ones).
"It's a very luxurious place, and you'll see a lot of rich men with a prize widow or just a high-paid partner."
"If you're going out to dinner, it's not worth it."
It's too bad you thought you could make it up to me.
"The service was very good, not as good as you expected for $500."
I admit cooking at Casa la femme is not like any other cooking experience!
I came home after visiting Casa La Femme and I was so angry about my visit that I had to warn other chefs who were worth their time and money.
"We're late for the reservation, so I couldn't complain too much about the waiting table."
This is so beautiful!
The host was very nice.
But our $14 drinks were terrible!
"And we asked for the hokka six times, and the waiter never came back with the hokka for a minute."
"I asked again the fourth time, and the waiter said what he said after dinner."
"We asked the parties, but the waiter admitted that he forgot to place this part of our order."
"My chickens weren't enough to eat because there were too many fat cubes, and I kept spitting on my fortune."
I didn't expect this for a $55 dinner.
"When we went out, our wallets and stomachs were broken, and we missed the show for dinner, so if we could just enjoy the good food and the belly dancing, it would be acceptable."
"If I could do that there, I'd pay my bills because my dinner didn't have my dinner part!"
"I've never left a restaurant, I feel like I've been abused, and I've spent my hard earned money."
"The menu is pretty simple, with no explanation."
"There was no wine beer that night, which was a disappointment."
"And not too much of a beer bottle choice, we chose Brahma."
"One order was a fried oyster and shrimp shrimp shrimp , but a small piece (three of each) was delicious ."
"Humber knuckles were good, but pretty nasty."
"I think there are two shrimp in the ""furry shrimp"" appetizer."
I got a Thai-style seafood fry.
"Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, except my brother, who fried the G mahi mahi, like it was soaked in grape juice."
I hear Humber's role is perfect.
All the food was good - a little expensive but fresh.
"Not the most friendly service to our ""big party""!"
A great Indian dish
"It was a great meal, and I love Indian food, and I eat it regularly, but it's one of the best meals I've ever had."
"""It's a very normal Indian dish, but it's very well made."
"I got 4 instead of 5 because of the price (only chicken tikka masala - no rice bread - $25), which I'll wait for at a luxury Indian restaurant, but this place doesn't feel luxurious."
"And waiters are trying to give you more food, even if they're worth $$, but they're offering something."
"But if you're willing to spend some money and don't forget to ask if anything he offers is free, then this is the place to go for Indian food."
The slogan of Bukhara Grill says it all.
"Lunch is expensive, but it's worth it."
"We've only been to dinner a few times, but it's the same quality and service."
Bukhara is one of my top five Indian places in New York .
I've never been so disgusted with food and service.
"But when I took a predictable average arrangement that Dokebi sees as a Korean party (you sometimes have to decide when it's the only option), I went halfway through our kimchi before finding a random salad piece with a much more disgusting, sticky, and obviously bad piece of fish skin."
"My main concern for myself is the reasonableness of the food being sent to me and to others, but I'm lying, and as a restaurant worker since I was 15, I expected the restaurant to make at least some effort to fix the situation."
"My girlfriend called me to tell me that I was wrong and probably an oyster, and that we were blacklisted from her restaurant because she was just as aggressive and disgusting to make her throw away the rest of her little meal."
"This restaurant wasn't as great as it used to be before, but it's just disgusting now."
It's a perfect place for a romantic dinner.
"I bought a nice white organza tent, it had a four-course menu, and we really enjoyed it."
The service was exceptional because the waiter knew everything about the menu and his advice was incredible!
I recommend Casa la femme for a special occasion and to make a real impact on your appointment.
"The drill was average, but the stone jar didn't even come close to popping."
I paid an extra $2 for the stone jar.
The cash-flow was terrible.
This is the worst fried squid I've ever tasted.
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than good Korean food.
I could have passed the side dishes and had them fill up on demand.
My real problem with this place was a complete lack of service .
My wife never touched a plate of that shit .
My wife drank risotto.
Farro salad and yummy potatoes were also delicious.
"I like Margherita's pizza, I like East Village pizza."
We love this place every time we're in town.
A precious piece of pizza
"The fear has a good bite and a good chewing, the sauce is light and the acidity is good, the salt from the cheese is great, it really enhances the taste of the other ingredients."
"I personally like Margarita better, but she's all right."
It could be the most romantic restaurant in town.
"This is my favorite modern Japanese brasserie, and I think it's one of the most romantic restaurants in town!"
"It's not just an adventure to enter this secret hidden place, but Zen and instinctive decoration will make you feel like you're no longer in the city."
"If you're planning on coming here, make sure the date is really your favorite, because you'll be taken to private cabins that don't have people or food watching (choose those with windows on the ceiling so you can see the stars in the sun!)."
"Just you and your friend and an occasional sweet... waitress' can, before you open the little curtain!"
"He had a $29 menu, which was a great deal, because he even brought a party cake."
We started with a nice sashimi.
"So I chose a fried black sea frog to eat, and I definitely swallowed it, even though someone said it was better to eat fried salmon."
Sake has completed her lessons very well and made it easy for me to enter the world of sake.
We tried frozen black mousse sausage for desserts (interesting but not unusual) and matcha (toasted green tea) and coffee cheese cakes.
"Maybe it was a great company (my friends from Philadelphia were visiting me) or a very reasonable price point, but I can't say enough about this brasserie."
"I don't usually visit the same facility again, but I'll come to Zenkichi anytime I want."
"Feeling like the service is asking for too much, feeling like you're running to where you ordered, ignoring the night."
"They're rude, they don't apologize for the terrible service, and they don't bill us more than $500 for a few drinks."
Big shadow shadow
"I tried a few more dishes, but I wasn't very impressed."
But you can't find anything better in New York for a shabby shabby.
"Fresh meat, the sauces are great, and the food is free with kimchi and salad, and the service is good."
The Dokebi provided Williamsburg with fusion brushes like classic Korean food and pork belly tacos.
"Hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason I'm here is the fantastic pork croquet sandwich that's perfect at the supermarket."
Restaurant with a view
The food was so good.
The family seafood was great.
The main course was great.
"It's expensive, but the food's good, so I could come back."
This place doesn't make any sense.
"This place has a really weird decorative staircase, M-mirror walls, and no one's broken their head and fallen off the stairs yet."
This place is uninvited and the food is weird.
The Japanese concept of tapas is new and obviously not working.
"The food is soothing, hungry, and uncooked."
Good food
"The food was delicious and delicious, but the seating area was too small."
It was all a beautiful romantic place .
"A colleague and I tried Pacifico after a few Fridays, and I liked it."
The atmosphere was great.
"The food we ordered was great, but I didn't say anything to write about margaritas."
"Our waiter wasn't bad, but he wasn't too warm or careful."
I was surprised by the bad reviews at the restaurant earlier this year.
"Still, we'll be back and we can't wait for our summer visit to use the garden."
"It seems that the servers of Flatbush Farm have developed a terrible technique to draw attention to you, to make you feel guilty and ashamed."
"A different server added to the fun, throwing our food in front of us in half our storage (which was delicious)."
"The overall quality of the food was pretty good, but I heard salmon is better when it's not cold in front of guests."
"It's a nice place, some attractive furniture and, as far as I know, a reasonable wine list."
How is this cork still open?
Everything was fine until we got the food .
I looked at the chickens and I panicked.
"Served on a bed with their skins, very little baked spinach and potatoes."
"I bit a 24-dollar salmon and went to restaurants in 17 years and never tasted salmon as soft as fish, dry and flatbush farms."
"At this point, the waiter came and asked if everything was okay, and I was so shocked I didn't say anything."
"So I switched with my boyfriend again, maybe I could have meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so little cooked, I couldn't bite."
"And that's what really got worse: The manager said, ""There's nothing we can do, it's just a matter of taste, and he didn't like it, and I can't accept it""."
"The manager came to the table and said we could do anything we wanted, so we bought the drinks and the pastries we enjoyed and went out."
This staff should be fired.
Cirpy crust margarita pizza
It was a really good pizza.
It's incredibly well cooked and the pizza is fully loaded:)
The worst restaurant in Manhattan.
"I had a few positive things: the nice decor, the beautiful P pita and hummus and the grilled G fur head were actually quite delicious."
"If I could give it 0 stars, I'd do it for this place."
"This place... oh, my God, where do I start?"
This is a pretty amazing scene.
"The decor looks distracting, so you won't notice that you're paying $300 for a cold wood that only lasts 2 hours!!!!"
"How this place survives in this economy, or any other area, in the competitive Western rural market, doesn't matter to me."
Great hot dogs.
"Although it's often crowded here, the hawks always feed."
Hot dogs are the best and slam-wiches are great!
It's worth the train ride to scream and make your tongue and stomach happy!
One complaint about pricing-- it's more reasonable to pay a dollar less for every item listed on the menu.
But still... great places.
Fabulous food - if the staff at the front of the house doesn 't bother you .
"Every time we went, the staff in front of the house (not the waiters - they're great - but the people who greet you and sit down) were so disgusting to us that I would never have come back if it wasn't for the amazing fish food."
You almost always have to wait at the bar because Bfc doesn't make a reservation and you have to be harassed by the people working in front of the house until you sit down after an hour!
"If you try to order a drink, the girl's curvy retro girls will yell at you."
I'd be scared if my staff turned their customers away so early and so rude!
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"", brown hair, she listens to you and bells - she only hears the last part of what you say, so her uninvited comments are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about."
"I'm looking forward to a better service, considering you're spending at least $60 a person."
"""Eat and go out"""
"The food and service were good, but the boss was incredibly unresponsive and arrogant."
"As we finished our meal, our son's fiancée joined us with a high-quality bottle of wine and a glass of wine and a dessert."
"He refused to sit down and he left, and soon after, the four of us followed, but before I told him that I had never seen such a bad behavior by a pioneer in a restaurant in my 40 years of traveling around the world, including Paris."
"A wise word: You can eat here and you can't disturb the masters' sense of ""transformation""."
It's the best food in a long time!
Saturday night's faucets and the stays were great.
I got a perfect lamb special.
"My father had a good steak, and my mother had a swordfish."
Four seasons of restaurant is a great experience.
The food is great and the environment is even better.
Raising the Hot Dogs to a Level
"At first glance, this place looks a little expensive for a hot dog place, but you can't buy a regular hot dog by barking."
Here the hot dog is raised to a real food level and there are various varieties.
It's a great atmosphere.
"I recommend fish tacos, everything else was fine."
"There's a cold atmosphere in the back of the fire pit, but it needs a little more heat on a cold night."
Bad service and management
Don't go in this place.
I had a terrible experience at Casa la femme on Saturday night.
The manager was rude and he handled things badly.
I can't imagine an expensive restaurant in NYC being so disrespectful to its customers.
"The food is good, but not extraordinary."
"The praise he gets, the attitude of the staff, or the waiting table, can't justify it."
"Mistakes are made, but they usually come with an apology, maybe even a glass of wine... but not the screams we get from the al di la staff."
"The bread was like the old one, the salad was too expensive and empty."
"The cake was well cooked, but not enough sauce or flavor."
The landlord was rude and I knew he didn't want to serve us.
"The only thing my friend forgot was when we were sitting at the bar, the bartender disappeared."
"I asked for the menu, and the same waiter looked at me like crazy."
"I was shocked to see my friends want to stay, and the waiter said, ""Can I help you?"" and ""How many people are at the party?"""
It's a shame about the horrible rude staff and the nonexistent customer service here.
Bad staff
I usually like this place.
The food is delicious.
This area is well designed.
But the service is terrible!
I was there for breakfast the other day and we were with a waiter and a waiter.
"The waiter, holding a bag that looked like a plastic bag in one hand, delivered our food."
The servant comes to check on us every few minutes and begins to clean the dishes while half are still eating (so I try to ignore the fact that almost everywhere there is a big pet filth).
I wish I could have liked this place better and had someone retrained my staff.
