I ordered a Vitello alla Marsala and I was impressed.
The calves and mushrooms were perfectly prepared.
Potato balls aren't dry... they were actually butter.
The worst place on Smith Street in Brooklyn.
"The immature bartender didn't know how to make drinks, the service was slow, the food was neither fresh nor warm, the waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and not paying much attention to all the customers."
"I would never recommend this place to anyone, even for an occasional dinner."
The food is always fresh ...
Extremely expensive Japanese food with mediocre service
Was there a tomato or a pepper on the teriyaki chicken?
The food was warm.
The waitress didn't pay any attention.
"I was looking for a banana tempura for dessert, and they don't have it."
Not because you're Season Four... you're allowed to charge your arm and leg for a romantic dinner.
"The food was great, and the service was great, but I left four seasons disappointed."
"I don't think dinner in Manhattan is worth $40,000 if I'm not thrown out."
"Red dragon roll is my favorite food, any food group, hands down."
Just go to Yamato and order a red dragon .
The dynamite of seafood is also foreign.
I love sushi in New York.
"A quiet spot on the park slope, dry land is always good, service is pleasant, efficient and modest."
"Summer months, the backyard is very nice."
"The rolls are creative, and I haven't found another sushi place to eat more inventive but delicious Japanese food."
"Dancing, the White River and the Millennium are the Mustangs."
I can eat here every day of the week. I love this place.
Hard food .
I don't remember the last time I ate such dirty food in New York.
My quiz was as tasty as a three-year-old without a sense of proportion or taste.
$ 11 and $ 11 for a plate of soft guacamole
Don't make me start with margaritas.
"Oh, and I never write reviews... I was just so touched by how bad this place was, I felt it was my duty to spread the word."
A great Indian food.
"The food was good, the place was clean and accessible."
"I've noticed a lot of Indians eating there, which is a great sign of an Indian place."
"It 's one of my favorite places , very relaxing food is always great , my engagement and wedding was celebrated here , it was very well organized ."
The staff is very good.
I like the menu of drinks.
I highly recommend this beautiful place.
"We were offered water on the table, but they didn't say Voss water bottles cost $8 a piece."
The food was fine.
Beautiful views of the river and New York
Excellent help .
"A beautifully designed, dreamlike Egyptian restaurant that becomes spectacular at night."
Look at the talented dancers enjoying a delicious lady.
"Oh, and there's corn."
Raymond Barman of the Rock!
The Pacific is a great place to relax.
"The drink is great, especially if it's made by Raymond."
The breakfast omelet is great...
"Spinach fresh, definitely not frozen..."
Quakamole in the Pacific is as good as chickpeas.
The chicken in the salads is weak.
I wasn't a fan of purple and sparkling rabbit myself.
"In general, decent food at a good price, with friendly people."
Best Indian restaurant in town
"The equipment needs to be upgraded, but the food is amazing!"
"This little ""Astolia Suwlaki"" stain does what many consider the best georous in New York."
"What really makes it brilliant is the food that is aggressively seasoned with cherry sauce, and everything is made in your own home (even the meat and sausage G-Gyro , and made from much higher quality ingredients that you would otherwise expect."
"All the different Greek and Cypriot dishes are great, but the Giro is the reason you came here - if you didn't eat alone your trip was in vain."
The best restaurant in Brooklyn
"Great food, amazing service, this place is a great act."
Last night was incredible.
This is a must-see place!
Most booths allow you to sit next to each other without looking like a couple.
The food is split so we can order and eat together.
My daughter's wedding reception on the waterfront received the highest compliments from our guests.
Everyone was amazed by the atmosphere (elegant rooms and absolutely unparalleled scenery and fabulous food).
The service was wonderful .
"Paul, Master D, was a professional and always on top of things."
Thank you all for coming to the waterfront.
"Okay, but the unfriendly, dirty bathroom."
"It's more than you pay for the look, not the food."
"Drinking at the bar was, to say the least, normal."
Things like tilapia were terrible... tasted like cardboard.
"We thought dessert would be better, but it's not!"
"Oh, speaking of the bathroom, the men's room was disgusting."
"The wine list was extensive, although the staff did not seem familiar with the varieties."
The bread we received was terrible -- hard and cold -- and the free appetite for olives was disappointing.
But our main course was great.
"I had a fish, and my husband had a filet, and they both exceeded our expectations."
"(We ate the peach cake was good - but, again, the staff were unable to provide the appropriate suggestions for drinks."
"When we asked about the ports, the waitress listed a few, but she didn't know the taste options or the price."
Not what I expected from the price and prestige of this place .
"Well, I would have come back, since it was a great restaurant, but I hope in the future the staff will pay more attention to the details."
"Short and sweet seats are great: it's romantic, cozy and private."
Both aren't as small as some reviews make them look perfect for two people.
"The service was very quick and thoughtful, but I barely understood a word when the waiter took our order."
"The food was fine, and there was nothing to drive me crazy."
Everything here is more than the actual dishes.
"So what you're really paying for is a restaurant, not food."
fine food and service
Nudle pudding is the kind of service and food I love.
"Servers are different, Greg is my favorite."
"Sometimes the tables don't understand his sense of humor, but it's refreshing to be a server who has personality, professionalism, and respect for the privacy of your dinner."
This is the first place a runner remembers my order... I hope he likes his job because I'm too smart to steal it for my restaurant.
prices for food and beverages are fair in general
"I go out to eat and I love my classes, the servers are patient and never rush to class or force another drink."
"Amazing fresh dogs , but best of all endless topping !"
This place had all the jewelry and I mean everything.
"This is an amazing pleasure for hot dog lovers of all ages, please do yourself a favor and look at this place!!!!"
"Last night, we walked into Woman's House, and it was a real experience unlike any other in New York!"
"I'm very impressed with the decor, the food, the hospitality and the wonderful night I had!"
We have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lemon juice and mint leaves to die for!
"Food is prepared for a while, and it's all worth waiting for."
We were involved in a belly dance show that captivated the crowd.
"I never write on these sites, but this restaurant deserves praise!"
Worms in food
"The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when it came to food, it was average."
"Still, I finished my plate, and then I found a worm in a mushroom sauce downstairs."
"I showed it to the manager , and he smiled and apologized and brought us two free desserts (but he didn 't ask us what we wanted , so he brought the last two desserts we would have asked for)."
"Eventually, the manager said he would sell two glasses of wine (which cost less than food), and made it look like a big concession."
"I worked in restaurants and cooked a lot, and there's no way worms could get into a well-cooked meal."
"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and which is usually so saturated, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service."
I 've got hair twice in my diet !
It's a great value.
"The food is delicious, abundant and affordable."
The atmosphere is calm and calm.
It's a great place to order or sit.
The sushi experience was incredible with my fiancé.
Good creative videos
"Yamata is a great place if you don't like sushi, or if you have friends who don't like sushi."
"They have great three-color videos, and Norwegian videos are amazing and fulfilling."
"One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save space for dessert."
"They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert, and they have a great Temper green tea."
The appetizers are delicious too!
Amazing food.
the inner shell
Good food .
"I've already eaten my share of modern Japanese, and this place delivers."
"The atmosphere was pretty good, but a little lacking, which she was trying to compensate with a crazy mirror scheme."
"Despite the tangled mirrors, it's probably going to be my favorite for modern Japanese food in the foreseeable future."
The Indian food is pretty good...
"It's a very refined place, but not very good Chinese cuisine, Indian style."
"Chicken lollipop is my favorite, most dishes (I must agree with the previous reviewer) are quite fatty and very spicy, especially chicken chili"
"My mother initially introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels that food can be a little overly spicy and too fat."
I was silent from the terrible food.
"I went to a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was very disappointing."
"Instead of cooking a vegetarian dish, the chef gave me a plate of boiled vegetables (minus sauce, seasonings or any shape or aesthetic presentation)."
This place only survives because of its reputation.
"This is the most wonderful restaurant in New York, not just in Brooklyn..."
"For seven years, they've been making the best, the best, the best food and keeping it like this..."
"Never hesitate, never bad food, never bad service."
"Great food , great wine , great service in a good neighborhood ."
Patsy 's pizza is true love .
You're giving me the best pizza in the world.
It 's a great hot dog .
Hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had a lot of crunchy and crunchy on the outside.
"Great topping, definitely a place to watch for late night snacks or a midday bonus!"
"I'm a little greasy with the food, but overall, it's a good experience."
The average price of a meal is $10.
The only thing that 's surprising you is the decor .
Good food .
There's great Indian Chinese food here.
"Be prepared to wait, because this place is quite small."
"Although the place isn't very nice, the food speaks for itself."
"The best Indian Chinese in town, by the way!"
"I ran into a village underground, and now I go there all the time."
Martini's amazing and very cheap.
"The service was amazing, I had different waiters, and they were good, which is rare in New York."
"DJ's amazing, I've been there for my birthday and a few times with my friends and I'm coming back."
It's all right on the menu.
This place is a real deal.
"I'd like more places like this: intimate, beautiful homes, high-end, all the time, probably worth the wait."
But $500 for a two-night lunch that didn't include wine?
"Look, the snacks were really good."
And it's also very tasty.
What you're paying for is the environment and the name.
"Yeah, it's a cool, beautiful place, but they're definitely targeting Uberville, not the average Joe who wants to pull it off every now and then."
"Vannison was good, but not amazing."
But the bison was great.
Desserts are a disaster.
"I read reviews that said the restaurant was too expensive and thought, maybe it's worth it."
"Four seasons have a history, and it's kind of a New York restaurant badge, but trust me, they'll charge you through the nose so you can say, ""I've been to a restaurant for four seasons""."
"Overall, the food was great (except for desserts)."
It's a very high-paid neighborhood and you'll see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just high-paid escorts.
"If you're going to get food, it's not worth it."
"You think they're compensating for that with service, unfortunately, they're not."
"It was a good service, not what you expected for $500."
I agree that dinner at Casa La Femme is like any other experience!
I literally just got home from visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit that I felt the need to try and warn other guests who value their money and time.
"We're late for the reservation, so I can't complain too much about waiting for the table."
This place is beautiful!
The hostess was very nice.
But our $14 drinks were terrible!
"We also asked for corn six times, and the waiter told us one minute and never came back with corn."
I asked again after the fourth time and the waiter said after our dinner.
We asked the parties that the waiter admitted he forgot to include that part of our order.
My chicken was not edible because there were so many fat pieces that I kept spitting them in my napkin.
I didn't expect that for $55.
"By the time we left, our wallets were full, and our stomachs were full, and we missed the show we were supposed to see after dinner, which would be acceptable if we could enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancing!"
"If it were possible, I wouldn't pay for it, because I don't have food!"
I've never left a restaurant feeling insulted and spent my hard earned money.
"The menu is pretty simple, without much explanation."
"There was no beer that night, which was a disappointment."
"Not much of a beer bottle choice, we chose Brahma."
"The snacks we ordered were fast-food - ordered fried oysters and shellfish were delicious, but in a small portion (maybe 3 of each)."
"Lobster's stems were fine, but not tasteful."
I think there were two shrimp in the Salt Shrimp appetite.
"I ate a Thai-style fried sea bass, which was really good."
"Everyone was usually happy with their food except my brother, who made grilled macha macha, apparently filled with grape juice!"
I hear lobster roll is great.
"All the food was good - a little expensive, but fresh."
Not the most friendly service for our big party!
A great Indian food.
"Indian food was amazing, and I love it and I eat it regularly, but I can say it's one of the best I've ever eaten."
"""It's very normal Indian food, but very well made."
"I have 4 instead of 5 because of the price (only chicken tick masala - no rice bread - $25), which I would expect from an elite Indian restaurant, but this place doesn't feel like an elite place."
"Also, the waiters try to get you to eat more, like they offer you stuff like it's free, when it's actually worth $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
"But if you're willing to spend a few dollars and don't forget to ask if there's anything they offer for free, this is the place to go for Indian food."
"The buhara-greal, the slogan says it all..."
"Buffet lunch is expensive, but it's worth it."
"We've only been to dinner a few times, but we get the same quality and service."
Bukhara is one of my top five places for New York Indians.
I've never been so disgusted with both food and service.
"However, once I got a predictably mediocre order of what Dockby thinks is a Korean fair (sometimes you have to pay when it's the only option), I went through half my kimchi before I found a piece of random salad accompanied by a much more disgusting, mucous, obviously bad piece of fish skin."
"My main concern was the healthy food I sent to myself and others, but I was lying when I said that as a person who has been working in restaurants since I was 15, I expected the restaurant to make the least effort to change things."
"My friend, who was a little bit more aggressive and was just as disgusting as she was to have thrown away the rest of the food, called to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was probably a sharp, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant."
"It wasn't like this restaurant had any big boasting points, but now it's just disgusting."
It 's a great place for a romantic dinner .
"I booked a beautiful white body room with four courses, and we really liked it."
"The service was amazing, as the waiter knew all about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!"
I highly recommend Casa la femme for any special occasion and to impress your date.
"The baby-beep was average, but the stone mouse wasn't even close to her chest."
I wish I had paid an extra $2 for a stone cup.
The naoki-bokum was terrible.
This is the worst fried squid I've ever tasted.
The sauce tastes better than a decent Korean fast food.
"The side dishes were passing, and I got them on demand."
The real problem here was a complete lack of services.
My wife barely touched this dish.
"My wife had a risotto, which was amazing."
The Farro salad and the Yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.
I like the pizza Margarita I like the pizza of the East Village
I love this place every time we're in town.
The quintessential piece of pizza
"Cork is different in taste and flavor, the sauce is light and acidic, the salt from the cheese is different, it really improves the taste of all the other ingredients."
"I personally prefer margarita pizza, but they're all good."
Probably the most romantic restaurant in town.
"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brunch (which does not serve sushi), and in my opinion one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!"
"Not only is it an adventure, but arriving at this somewhat secluded point where you walk into a separate wooden door, a zen and an intimate setting will make you feel like you're no longer in town."
"If you plan on coming here, make sure your date is the one you really like, as you'll be taken to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose those on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you can see the stars in the sky!)."
"It's just you and your date, and sometimes, sweetie, excuse me until the waiter opens a little curtain to your office!"
"My party had a $29 Fix Prix menu, which was great, because it was also supplied with a sake flight!"
We started with the delicious Sashimi-Muz-Amuza.
"I picked a fried black garbage as a starter, which I completely swallowed until someone said fried salmon was better."
Sake got a very good grade and successfully introduced me to the world of Sake.
"For desserts, we tried frozen black sesame seeds (interesting, but not exclusive) and matcha (green tea in powder) and a syrup and berry cake, which was phenomenal."
"Maybe it was a great company (I had friends from Philadelphia, yeah, this time it wasn't a date) or a super reasonable price, but I just can't say enough good things about this brewery"
"I don't usually visit the same institution more than once, or more than twice, but I'll be coming to Tsengqi anytime for a quiet, non-hurried and unforgettable dinner."
"Service leaves much to be desired, from feeling rushed to where you order to being ignored all night."
"They're very rude, they don't even apologize for the terrible service we've been given and they bill us over $500 for a few drinks and their bread."
The great shabba shabba
"I tried a couple of other dishes, but I wasn't impressed."
But you won't find a better place in New York for a shabby shabby.
"The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and salad for free with food, and the service is good too."
Dockie gives Williamsburg the right shot at classic Korean food and the fusion twists like a pig-belly tak
"Hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason I came here is a fantastic pork croquet sandwich perfect for his supermarket."
A restaurant with a view
The food was very good.
The family seafood was very good.
The main breakfast was very good too.
"The price is high, but the food is good, so I'd come back."
This place doesn't make sense.
"This place has a very strange decorative staircase that goes up against the mirror walls, and I'm surprised no one's ever broken their head or fallen down a ladder."
"This place is not inviting, and the food is completely strange."
Japanese tapas is a concept that just came out and it's obviously not working.
"The food they serve is not comforting, does not make you feel good, and is not cooked."
Good food
"The food was delicious, but the seat was too small, I don't like being in the corner."
It was a very beautiful romantic place .
My colleague and I tried Pacifico after work for a few Fridays and we liked it.
The atmosphere was great.
"The food we ordered was great, although I wouldn't say margaritas is something you can write home about."
"Our waitress was not mean, but she was not particularly warm or attentive."
"I must say, I'm surprised by the bad reviews about the restaurant earlier this year."
"Anyway, we'll be back and can't wait to visit the summer to enjoy the yard."
The servers at Flatbush Farm seem to have perfected this awful technique to make you feel guilty and ashamed of having attracted their attention.
Another server improved the fun by throwing our snacks halfway through the appetizer (which was delicious).
"Overall, the food quality was pretty good, although I've heard that salmon is much better when it's not cold in front of a guest."
"This place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furniture and, in my opinion, a reasonable wine list (I was given a menu when I asked for de vines)"
"What do you mean, this beam's still open?"
Everything was fine until we got food .
I looked at the chicken and was shocked.
It was pressed with leather over a bed of extremely poorly cooked spinach and potatoes.
"I ate one piece of salmon for $24 and in 17 years of restaurant work, I've never tasted salmon as fishy, dry, ugly as Flat Bush farms."
"At that point, the waitress comes in and asks if we're okay, and I was literally so shocked, I was silent and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress left."
"So I went over with the guy again to see if I could handle the meat and the spinach again, but the spinach was so raw that I just couldn't bite it."
"That's where it gets really bad: the manager says there's absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste, and she didn't like it, and I can't help it."
"The manager came to the table and said we could do whatever we wanted, so we paid for the drinks and snacks and left."
This staff must be fired.
The cirpi-corst of Margarita Pizza
It was a really good pizza.
The cork was amazingly well prepared and the pizza was fully loaded:):)
The worst restaurant in Manhattan.
"I'll go with a couple of positive ones: great decor, good nutritious hummus and a G-heated octopus hat was actually pretty good."
"If I could give it 0 stars, I would do it for this place."
"This is the place... my God, where I'm gonna start."
It's a pretty spectacular scene.
"The decor, however, seems to be distracting, so you won't notice that you just paid $300 for a cold tub that took 2 bloody hours to come in!!!!"
"How this place survives in a competitive market in the Western Village in this economy, or any other, is beyond me."
Great hot dogs .
"Although there are many people here, I've been here a lot, the paws always deliver their food."
"Hot dogs are the best, and their slam-dots are amazing!"
"Walking to bark is always worth a trip, and it will make your tongue and stomach very happy!"
The only complaint about pricing is that I think it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less for each item on the menu.
But still... great point great food
Fairy food - if the staff at home doesn 't distract you
"Every time we were there, the staff at home (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and sit) were so disgusting to us that if it wasn't for the exceptional fish dishes, I would never have come back."
"The BFC doesn't accept reservations, so you almost always have to wait at the bar and be raped by employees outside the house until you sit down, which can be more than an hour later!"
Frizzy retro girl (with courtyard / lady Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.
I'd be horrified if my staff rejected clients so early and rude!
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" with brown hair, who listens to your conversation and calls - only she hears the last part of what you're saying, so her unbiased opinions often go out of context and have nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about."
"Considering you're spending at least $60 a head, I expect better service."
"""Eat and go"""
"The food and service were fine, but the master class was incredibly unwelcome and arrogant."
"After we finished our lunch, which included a top-notch bottle of wine, our son's bride joined us for a glass of wine and dessert."
"This guy refused to arrest her, and she left, and then the four of us, but not before I told him that in 40 years of traveling the world, including Paris, I'd never seen such bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant."
"The wise say, you shouldn't eat here and bother the master about ""changing tables"", no matter what it looks like, otherwise."
Best dish in a long time!
The muskets and squash were great on Saturday night.
I had a special sheep that was perfect.
"My father ate a flange steak, which was very good, and my mother a swordfish."
Four Seasons is a great experience.
The food is great and the environment is even better.
Bringing hot dogs to the next level
"At first glance, this place seems a little expensive for a hot dog, but on the heel you don't just get an average hot dog."
"Here, the hot dog rises to the level of the actual snack with numerous options."
It 's a great atmosphere .
"I highly recommend tacos, everything else was fine."
"It's a really cool atmosphere, and the fire department is in the back, but it takes a little bit more heat on a cold night."
Bad service and management
Don't go to this place.
I had a terrible experience at Casa la femme at Saturday's dinner.
The manager was rude and very badly handling the situation.
I can't believe an expensive restaurant in New York can be so disrespectful to its customers.
"The food is very good, but not excellent."
"There's no reason to justify the rewards he gets, the attitude of the staff or the wait for the table."
"Mistakes happen, but they're usually accompanied by an apology, maybe even a glass of wine... but not the sadness we got from Al di La employees."
"The bread was outdated, the salad was too expensive and empty."
"The pasta was well prepared, but there wasn't enough sauce and taste."
"The hostess was rude, and I felt they didn't want to serve us."
"The only thing my friend left is that when we sat down at the bar, the bartender disappeared."
"I asked for the menu, and the same waitress looked at me like I was crazy."
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""Can I help you?"" and ""How many people are at your party?"""
Shame on this house for the terrible rude staff and lack of customer service.
Bad staff
I like this place.
The food is good.
The design of the space is good.
But the service is terrible!
"I was there for breakfast recently, and we were on the waitress and waitress team."
"The waiter was delivering food to us, holding in one hand a plastic garbage bag."
"The waitress would come check on us every few minutes, and she started cleaning the plates while half of us were still eating (my big home-cooked meal, which happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it)."
"I wish I liked this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff."
