"From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitress, I felt like a king and enjoyed every second of it."
"Since we were the last guests and it was after closing time, the waitress did not rush us and made us feel comfortable and relaxed."

My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!
"As a result, their burger fell apart in their hands and caused so much chaos that they didn't feel like ending it."
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.
"It's a trend, but they forgot the most important part of a restaurant."
"The last two times I ordered here, my food was so spicy that I could barely eat it, and the spices were also out of the taste of the plate."
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
"If you want good authentic Thai, this is not the place."
"We were here for lunch a few weeks ago, and I was very impressed with the food."

A Thai restaurant without rice during dinner?

"The service was great, the food was fantastic."

You can 't go wrong .
"The food is excellent and the service is fast, friendly and very professional."
"Always a nice crowd, but never loud."
I'm hesitant to write because I don't want my pizza place to get crowded.
- The best pizza in Manhattan.

The menu has so many fish items and oysters.
The fish was really fresh.
We all agreed that Mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York.
I ran into a big pizzeria while exploring my new neighborhood.

Mizu is home to creative and unique roles that you can't find anywhere else.
"Not only is the kitchen the best, but the service was always attentive and charming."
Warning: You may find it difficult to eat in other Japanese restaurants after visiting Mizu
"Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite fit."
I ordered the smoky salmon and the roe game and it wasn't tasty.
"The entrance was small and weak, the dessert was uninspired."
I expected a lot more from such an expensive menu.

Large neighbourhood
This is a nice pizza place with a good selection of thin crustal pizza including basil cheese.
"Your calzones are terrible, bad, causing vomiting, junk."
Customer service is bad.
No pizza 33 for me!
"The cans are narrow, unattractive and greasy, and I personally would drink popcorn topping before I eat another one of them."
"The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and far too expensive."
"Hampton Chutney warns that these people offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive space with helpless employees, there was also a lack of first class."
This is a real asshole.
"The atmosphere is unheard of, the service is unheard of, and the food is great."
The best Italian food I've ever eaten (and being Italian means a lot).

The service is terrible.
This place is not worth it.
I like pizza 33 .
I'm out with friends and suddenly I'm hungry and I just want one thing... their pizza.
This little place in Williamsburg is always pleasantly surprising.
The pizza is delicious and the owner is one of the finest in New York.
The cream cheese is out of this world and I love this coffee !
"Bagels are fine, but don't make any special requests."
I asked for an open-cheese sandwich and the manager told me to do my business elsewhere!
You should get nothing but bagels .
The turkey burgers are terrible!
The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever met.
The soup for the Udon was soy sauce and water.
The sushi was terrible!
The rice was of poor quality and so poorly cooked that it was heavy.
"Besides, the rice didn't have any spices, so the sushi was dirty and disgusting."
"The fish was cut enough, but unknowingly."
It's obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea or experience of Japanese cuisine.
Good and fast service
Food is good and cheap.
This place is perfect.
"Well, it's such a ghetto, it's not even funny."
"If you like to mess up your music and the system isn't that good and you want to pay at least $100 for a bottle minimum, then you're gonna love it here."

It's definitely a good place for snacks and conversations.
"As a retired hipster, I can say with some certainty that Lucky Strike was the best relaxed night in town last year."
"The waiting area is pleasant, fun and usually beautiful (in the wonderful aesthetic display, not in the way it is more beautiful than I am)."
"The food is delicious, especially its cooked to perfect shells in a spicy tomato sauce and its crispy, sticky fries"
But the best thing about LS is the nighttime atmosphere that's free of BTS.
You can have a perfectly flawed Martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the vanilla shade mmmm!) in a big house with great music.
The DJ on Saturday night has a great musical flavor and also accepts requests.
You can't go wrong.
Suan is a great place to take my friends.
The location is good and the fact that Hutner College is nearby and the prices are very reasonable makes the students return to Suan again and again.
I love her Thai.
Shark noodles and chicken and coconut juice are a must!
I'll be back in Suan soon!
"In the summer, eat out on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!"
I can't imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.
I can't think of a better Indian food in the whole city.
"In the last three months, the boss and the staff have changed, and it hasn't been for the better."
The food is not consistent right now.
This is the kind of place you take your friends and still want to keep a secret.
The environment is casual and romantic.
The food is delicious!

"You don't have hamburgers, no matter what the critics say."

A few tips: skip the R.T.T. roast pork and egg rolls
The food was exceptional.
"I picked one of the specialties, the roasted lamb ham in red wine, which was excellent."
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was calm.
"The restaurant is a little noisy, but that's something you can miss when you sit down and enjoy a great meal."
This little town has a sweet interior and affordable city prices.
"The Pad Se Ew chicken was delicious, but the Pad Thai was way too fat."
"I've eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good."
The roasted dumplings are great!

It's also great to eat in a very romantic and comfortable place. The service is just perfect. They're so friendly that we never want to live there!

Big bagels made the old way.

The food was absolutely fantastic!!
The baked shells we shared as a starter were the best we ever had!!
"The lamb was so tender and full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!"
The waiter was attentive.
The place itself is beautiful.
"Dinner in the city center 2002 - Price: Preparations were fine, waiter gave me a bad suggestion..try the potato stuff Kanish Best."
Small portions to the main entrance I had salmon (which was not impressed) girlfriend had chicken it was good.
The dessert is a joke.
"When we call virgins or weekly friends, they're all treated the same and you can't ask for more if the service is so friendly."
The Commission has the possibility to assist the Commission in order to support the Commission.
"Anti-pasta was excellent, especially the Kalamari and the filling pasta main."
The wine list is extensive and you can easily build up an otherwise inexpensive meal

The shrimp were excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
"If you're moving away from Manhattan Island and you can't find a great Italian restaurant, you're going to Corona."

A cozy romantic atmosphere with a maximum of 15 tables.
"The service was very fast, but slightly hasty."
"The food was very good, but not as I would see it from this world."
It's a shame the food wasn't from the same source.
"The porcini paste soup special was tasteless, as were the seafood tagliatelle"
But that wasn't the ice cream on the cake. It was a tiramisu that never looked like me.
I really liked this place.
Here are the best Chinese-style cracks.
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different types of congee (Risspoh)
It's definitely not a place to go if you want to impress someone.

Fast and friendly service

We were sitting outside and the waiter was spitting red wine and hot tea on me and my date.

"I was also surprised by all the new additions in recent years: a new jazz bar, the most fantastic dining room, the best, the thin crustal pizzas, and now a L-lasagna menu that you have to die for (these aren't the average lasagnas)!"
I love this place.

The dynamite from seafood is also from other worlds.
My favorite sushi in New York

The roles are creative and I have to find another sushi place to serve more inventive yet delicious Japanese food
"The dance, the White River and the Millennium Rolls are must-have."
I can eat here every day .
I can't stand the food.
I can't remember the last time I ate so badly.
My quesadilla tasted like it was made by a three-year-old without any sense of proportion or taste.
And $11 for a plate of soft guacamole .
I don't want to start with the margaritas either.
I was so impressed with how bad this place was that I felt it was my duty to spread the word.
Large Indian dishes
"The food was good, the store was clean and affordable."
"I ate a lot of Indians there, which is a great sign of an Indian place."
"It's one of my favorite places, very relaxing. The food is always good. I celebrated my engagement and my wedding here. It was very well organized."
The staff is very good.
I love her drinks menu.
I highly recommend this beautiful place.
"We were offered water for the table, but they didn't tell us the water bottles were $8 a piece."
The food was fine.
Beautiful views of the river and NYC
Great help
"A beautifully designed, dreamlike Egyptian restaurant that becomes beautiful at night."
Look at the talented belly dancers as you enjoy a delicious baba gonaush.
"Oh, and there's the hook"
Raymond the bartender is coming up!
Pacifico is a great place to relax.
"The drinks are great, especially if they're made by Raymond."
The brunch omelette is great.
"The spinach is fresh, definitely not frozen..."
"Quacamole at Pacifico is delicious, as are the Chimmichuri wings."
One weakness is the chicken in the salads.
I personally wasn't a fan of Portobello and Stampede.
"A good meal at a good price, with friendly people."
Best Indian restaurant in town
"The facilities need to be improved, but the food is fantastic!"
This little Astoria Souvlaki spot does what many consider the best Gyros in New York.
"What really shines is the food, which is aggressively flavored with zirconium spices and everything is made in-house (including the G-Gyro meat and sausage, and from much higher quality ingredients that would otherwise be expected."
"All the different Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the Giro is the reason to come - if you didn't eat, your trip was wasted."
Best restaurant in Brooklyn
It's a classic act.
The beef was incredible last night.
It's a must!
Most stalls allow you to sit next to each other without looking like a couple.
"The food's all shared, so let's order together and eat together."
My daughter's wedding at the waterfront received the highest compliments from our guests.
"Everyone was thrilled with the atmosphere (elegant rooms, absolutely incomparable views, and fabulous food)."
The service was wonderful .
Paul the Master D. was professional and always at the top.
Thank you to everyone at the water's edge.
"- Okay, but unfriendly, dirty."
"The high prices you're gonna pay are for the view, not the food."
"The drinks were good, to put it this way."
That Tilapia thing was terrible... taste like cardboard.
"We thought dessert would be better, but we were wrong!"
"Oh, speaking of bathrooms, the men's bathroom was disgusting."
The wine list was extensive - although the staff did not seem familiar with the wine pairs.
"The bread we received was terrible - hard and cold - and the ""free"" olive process was disappointing."
But our main meal was wonderful.
I had fish and my husband had the toilets that both exceeded our expectations.
The afternoon break (we had a pear cake) was good - but again the staff could not give suitable drink suggestions.
"When we ask about ports, the waitress lists several but doesn't know what the change of taste or the cost is."
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this place.
"All in all, I'd go back because it was a beautiful restaurant, but I hope the staff will pay more attention to the little details in the future."
"It's short and sweet, it's great, it's romantic, it's cozy, it's private."
"They're not as small as some of the ratings make them look, they're perfect for two people."
"The service was extremely quick and attentive, thanks to the service button on your desk, but I barely understood a word when the waiter took our order."
"The food was good and fair, nothing to make you crazy."
Everywhere the look of the place goes beyond the actual meals
"So what you really pay for in the end is the restaurant, not the food."
Subtle food and services
Nut pudding is exactly the kind of service and food I like.
"Servers are all different, Greg is my favorite."
"Sometimes the tables don't understand his sense of humor, but it's refreshing to have a server that has personality, professionalism, and respect for the privacy of your food."
"This is the first time a runner remembers my order, and I hope he likes his job because I want to steal it for my restaurant."
Food and beverage prices are usually fair
"I go to dinner and like my classes, the servers are patient and never rush classes or force another drink."
"Amazing fresh dogs , but best endless topping !"
This place had all the jewelry and I mean everything.
Amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check out this place!!!!
Last night at Casa la femme was a real experience that no one else in New York had.
"From the establishment to the food and hospitality to the big night I had, I was very impressed."
"You have a good cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon juice and lemon leaves, which you have to die for!"
"The meal took a while, and it was all worth the wait."
"We were drawn to the belly dance show, which fascinated the crowd."
"I never write on these websites, but this restaurant is a compliment!"
Worms in food
"The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average."
"Still, I finished my plate and then I found a stomach in the mushroom sauce downstairs."
"I showed it to the manager, and he apologized with a smile and brought us two free desserts (but he didn't ask us what we wanted, so he brought the last two desserts we asked for)."
The manager finally said that he would make the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the meal) a big concession.
"I've worked in restaurants and cooked a lot, and there's no way a worm should come into well-cooked food."
"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and usually so crowded, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service."
I 've already had two hairs in my food .
"A great place, a great value."
"The food is tasty, plentiful and cheap."
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.
It's a great place to order or sit.
I had an incredible sushi experience with my fiancee.
Beautiful creative roles
Yamato is a great place if you don't like sashimi or if you have friends who don't like much sushi.
The T-triple color and the Norwegian rolls are great and filling.
"A special role and a normal role are enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert."
You have a delicious banana-chocolate dessert and a big G-green tea Tempura.
The appetizers are delicious too!
Amazing food
Interior
Good food
I enjoyed my share of modern Japanese and this place delivers.
"The atmosphere was pretty nice, but there was something missing that she wanted to balance with a crazy mirror system."
"Despite the confusing mirrors, this will probably be my choice for modern Japanese food in the foreseeable future."
Indian-Chinese food is pretty good...
"A very chic place, but not very good Chinese food."
"Most dishes (I must agree with an earlier critic) are quite fatty and very spicy, especially chicken chili"
"My mother originally brought me here, but even she (as an Indian) feels that the food can be a little overly spicy and way too fat."
I was speechless because of the terrible food
"I was at a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was very disappointing."
"Instead of preparing vegetarian food, the chef gave me a plate of stolen vegetables (minus sauce, spices, or some form of aesthetic representation)."
This place only survives on reputation.
"This is the most wonderful restaurant in New York City, not just in Brooklyn."
"You've been making the best, most delicious food for seven years and keeping it that way."
"Never swing, never eat badly, never serve badly."
"Great food , great wine list , great service in a great neighborhood ."
Patsy's Pizza is true love.
The best pizza on the planet.
- Very good hot dogs .
The hot dogs were clean and tender on the inside and had a lot of crunch and snap on the outside.
A place to look for a nighttime meal or a lunchtime boost!
"I think the food is a little greasy, but the food is good."
Ready to help and average price per plate is $10.
The only thing that impresses you is the decor .
Good food
There's great Indian Chinese food here.
"Be prepared to wait, because the place is quite small."
"Although the place is not beautiful, the food speaks for itself."
"The best Indian Chinese in town, by far!"
"I happened to run into the village basement, now I always go there."
The Martinis are amazing and very cheap.
"The service is amazing, I had different waiters and they were all nice, which is rare in New York."
"The DJ's great, I've been to my birthday party and a few other times with friends and I come back all the time."
Everything on the menu is great.
This is the right place.
"I wish I had more places like this: intimate, great food, top-notch home, all the time, worth the wait."
But $500 for a dinner for two that doesn't include wine?
The starter was really good.
The entrance was very good too.
What you're paying for is the environment and the name.
"Yeah, the place is elegant and beautiful, but they're targeting the Uber Whealthy, not the average Joe who wants to go out on his own every now and then."
"Vanison was good, but not incredible."
"Bison was pretty good, though."
This is a disaster.
"I read reviews that said the restaurant was too expensive, and I thought maybe it was worth it."
"The four seasons have history, and it's kind of a hallmark of New York City restaurants, but believe me, they're gonna burden you with their noses just so you can say, ""I was at the Four Seasons restaurant""."
"The food was great, all in all (except for the desserts)."
The surroundings are very luxurious and you see many rich men with trophy wives or only high-paid escorts.
"If you go after dinner, it's not worth it."
You'd think they'd make it up to you with service.
"The service was fine, it's not what you'd expect for $500."
I agree that eating at Casa la femme is like no other experience!
I just got home from visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit that I felt compelled to warn other hosts who value their money and their time.
"We're late for our reservation, so I can't complain too much about the waiting time for a table."
This is beautiful!
The hostess was very pleasant.
But our drinks were terrible.
We also asked for hookah six times and the waiter told us about a minute and never came back with the hookah.
"After the fourth time, I asked again, and the waiter said that I didn't want to after our dinner."
We asked for pages the waiter admitted he forgot to include this part of our order.
My chicken was malnourished because there were so many fatty nodes that I had to spit in my napkin over and over again.
I didn't expect this for a $55 dinner.
"When we went out, our wallets and stomachs were empy and we missed the show we were supposed to see after dinner, which would have been acceptable if we could enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancing!"
"If it seemed possible to do so while I was there, I would have fought my bill, since my dinner was an indispensable part of my meal!"
I never left a restaurant like I was abused and wasted my hard earned money.
"The menu is pretty simple, without much description."
"There was no knocking that night, which was a disappointment."
We didn't drink much with a glass of beer either.
"The pre-orders we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and shellfish was delicious, but a tiny serving (perhaps 3 of each)."
"The lobster nuts were fine, but pretty tasteless."
I think there were two shrimp in the salt cramp appetite.
"I had Thai-style fried sea bass, which was very good."
"Everyone was satisfied with their food except my brother, who had the G-grill Mahi Mahi, who was apparently soaked in grapefruit juice!"
I heard the lobster roll was excellent.
"Everything was fine - a little on the expensive side, but fresh."
"The service is not the most friendly for our ""big party""!"
Large Indian dishes
"The food was fantastic - I love Indian food and eat it regularly, but I can say that this is one of the best I've ever eaten."
"""very normal Indian food, but very well made."
"I got it 4 instead of 5 because of the price (only chicken tikka masala - no rice bread - is $25), which I would expect in a luxurious Indian restaurant, but this place doesn't feel luxurious"
"The waiters are also trying to give you more food, like things that cost you, like they're a compliment."
"But if you're willing to spend something and remember to ask if anything they offer is free, then this is the place to eat Indian food."
"Bookhara Grill, the motto says it all."
"Lunch is expensive, but it's worth it."
"We've only been to dinner a few times, but the quality and service are the same."
Buchhara is in my top five Indians in New York.
I've never been so repulsive to both food and service.
"But when I got my predictable moderation of what Dokebi thinks is Korean fair (sometimes you have to decide if it's his only option), I got about half my kimchi before I found a random piece of salad, accompanied by a much more disgusting, mucky, clearly bad piece of fish skin."
"My biggest concern was the health of the food that was sent to me and others, but I'm lying, and I said that as someone who's been working in restaurants since I was 15, I expect at least minimal effort from the restaurant side to change the situation."
"My friend, a little more aggressive and just as disgusting because she had to throw away the rest of her barely eaten meal, called back, only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were blacklisted from her restaurant, too."
"It wasn't like this restaurant had any major boasting points before, but now it's just disgusting."
A beautiful place ideal for a romantic dinner.
I booked a beautiful white organza tent that included a four-process fix menu that we really enjoyed.
"The service was spectacular, for the waiter knew all about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!"
I recommend Casa la femme for any special occasion and to impress your date.
"The bibimbap was average, but the stone bottle wasn't even close to the vibration."
Too bad I paid two bucks more for the stone bottle.
The Nakgi Bokum was terrible.
This is the worst fried calamar I've ever tasted.
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.
"The sub-court was fit, and I got a refill on request."
The real problem I had here was the complete lack of service.
My wife had barely touched that dish.
"The woman had the risotto, which was fantastic."
The Farro salad and the Yukon potatoes were also very delicious.
I love margarita pizza I love the east village pizza
We love this place when we're in town.
A typical NYC pizza.
"The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light and has a nice acidity, the salt from the cheese is great, it enhances the taste of all the other ingredients."
"I personally like margarita pizza better, but they're all good."
Probably the most romantic restaurant in town.
This is undoubtedly my favorite Japanese brass (which does not serve sushi) and in my opinion one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!
"It's not just an adventure to get to this somewhat hidden place, entering the unknown wooden doors, the Zen and the intimate decoration will make you feel like you're no longer in the city."
"If you want to come here, make sure your date is someone you really like, as you'll be taken to private stands where no people or food will be observed (choose the ones on the ground floor that have glass ceilings so you can see the stars in the sky!)."
It's just you and your date and an occasional sweet excuse me before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!
"My party had the BBE $29 Fix Prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal, since it also came with a sake flight!"
We started with a nice sashimi-amusing mouth.
"I chose the grilled black shark as the entry, which I absolutely ate, while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better."
The sake has been a very good celebration of the courses and has successfully brought me into the sake world.
"For dessert, we tried the frozen black sesame seeds (interesting but not unusual) and matcha (powdered green tea) and the blueberry cheese, which was phenomenal."
"Maybe it was the great company (I had friends from Philadelphia who came to visit me) or the super reasonable price, but I can't say enough good about this bracery."
"I usually don't visit more than once, which is more than twice, but I come to Zenkichi at any time for a quiet, thoughtless and unforgettable dinner."
"The service leaves much to be desired, from the feeling of being able to reach the place of order to a night out."
"They're extremely rude, they don't even apologize for the terrible service we've been given and they're giving us a bill of well over $500 for a few drinks and their pita bread."
great shabu shabu
"I tried a few other dishes, but I wasn't very impressed."
"But for Shabu Shabu, you can't find much better in New York."
"The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad for free with your meal and the service is good too."
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos
"The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason I came here is the fantastic pig-croquet sandwich perfect on his supermarket clothes line"
Restaurant with a view
The food tasted very good.
The family seafood reception was very good.
The main court was very good too.
"The price is high, but the food is good, so I'll be back."
This is not making sense.
This place has a very strange decor stairs with mirrored walls I'm surprised no one has ever broken their head or fallen off the stairs mirrored walls make you dizzy and crazy...
It's not inviting and the food is totally weird.
The Japanese tapas concept has been re-emerged and clearly doesn't work.
"The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing, and not spoken."
Good food
"The food was good and delicious, but the seat was too small, I don't like having cramps in a corner."
It was a very beautiful romantic place .
"A colleague and I tried Pacifico a few Fridays after work, and we liked it."
The atmosphere was great.
"The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say that margaritas are something you can write about at home."
"Our waitress was not mean, but she was not particularly warm or attentive."
"I must say, I'm surprised by the restaurant's poor ratings earlier this year."
We'll be back soon and can't wait to visit in the summer to use the supplies.
"The servers at Flatbush Farm seem to perfect this terrible technique, to make you guilty and ashamed because you're attracting their attention."
Another server added to the fun and threw our supplies in front of us halfway through our appetizers (which was delicious).
"The overall quality of the food was quite good, although I hear that the salmon is much better off if it doesn't cool off in front of the guest."
"The store has nice facilities, some attractive furniture and, as I could tell, a reasonable wine menu (I got the menu when I asked for the wine menu)"
How's that cock still open?
Everything was fine until we had our meals .
I looked at the chicken once and was horrified.
"It was served with leather, over a bed of extremely unroasted spinach and potatoes."
"I took a bite from a $24 salmon and in the 17 years I've been to restaurants, I've never tasted salmon as fishy, dry, and sloppy as the one on the flatwood farms."
"At that point, the waitress comes and asks us if everything's okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress is gone."
"So I switched with my boyfriend again to see if I could make some meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so badly cooked that I just couldn't bite through it."
"It's really getting bad here: The manager said we can't do anything about it, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I can't make it up to her."
"The manager came to the table and said we could do whatever we wanted, so we paid for what we enjoyed, the drinks and the snacks and left."
This employee should be fired.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
It was a really good pizza.
The crust was incredibly well cooked and the pizza was full:)
The worst restaurant in Manhattan
I'm with a few positive points: Cool decoration good Pita and Hummus and G grilled cockroach hat was actually pretty delicious.
"If I could give 0 stars , I 'd do it for this place ."
"This place... God, where do I start?"
This is a spectacular scene.
"But the decor seems to be the distraction, so you don't notice that you just paid $300 for a cold egg goose that took 2 bloody hours to come in!!!!"
"How this place survives the competitive West Village market in this economy, or any other, is superfluous to me."
Big hot dogs
"Although it was often crowded, most of the time when I was here, the shallow animals always gave their food."
The hot dogs are top notch and the slamwich is fantastic!
Laughter is always worth the train ride and will make your tongue and belly very happy!
The only complaint is pricing - I think it would be more reasonable to pay one dollar less for each item on the menu
But still - great place great F-food
Fabulous food - if the employee doesn't scare you off
"Every time we were there, the employee (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and sit with you) was so disgusting to us that I would never come back without the exceptional fish dishes."
"Since the BFC does not make reservations, you almost always have to wait at the bar and be abused by the main thing until you sit down, which can be an hour later!"
The fresh retro girl (with wings / Lady Edna glasses) will scream at you when you try to order a drink.
I'd be horrified if my staff turned away clients so early and so rude!
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" with brown hair, who listens to your conversation and listens -- except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her unspoken opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're really talking about."
"Considering you're going to spend at least $60 a person, I expect better service."
"""Eat and go out""."
"The food and the service were good, but the master was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant."
"While we were finishing our meals, which included a high-quality bottle of wine, our son's fiancée came to us for a glass of wine and desserts."
"This guy refused to sit her down, and she walked right after the four of us, but only when I told him that in my 40 years of traveling the world, including Paris, I had never seen such an exhibition of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant."
"A word for the wise: You can't eat here and disturb the master's sense of ""turning the table"", no matter how crazy it is, or whatever."
The best food in a long time!
Muskets and calamari were wonderful on Saturday night.
"I had the lamb special, which was perfect."
"My father had the flank steak, which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish."
Four Seasons Restaurant is a great experience.
The food is good and the environment is even better.
To take hot dogs to the next level .
"At first glance, this place seems a little expensive for a hot dog bar, but barking doesn't just get you your average hot dog."
Here the hotdog is raised to the level of a real entry with numerous variations.
It's a great atmosphere.
"I recommend the fish tacos, everything else was fine."
The cold is in the cold.
Poor service and poor management
Don't go to this place.
I had a terrible experience at the Casa la femme on Saturday night.
The manager was rude and treated the situation very badly.
I can't believe an expensive New York restaurant treats its customers so disrespectfully.
"The food is very good, but not excellent."
There is no way to justify the awards it receives by hiring staff or waiting for a table.
"Mistakes happen, but they're usually accompanied by an apology, maybe even a glass of wine... but not the grounds we got from the Al di La staff."
"The bread was outdated, the salad was too expensive and empty."
"The pasta was well cooked, not had enough sauce or flavor."
"The hostess was rude, and I felt like they didn't want to serve us."
The only thing my friend left out was that the bartender disappeared when we were sitting in the bar.
"I asked for a menu, and the same waitress looked at me like I was crazy."
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""Can I help you?"" and ""How many people are at your party?"""
Shame on the terrible rude staff and the lack of customer service.
Bad employees
I like this place.
The food is good.
The design of the room is good.
But the service is terrible!
I was at a brunch recently and we were accompanied by a waitress and a waiter.
The waiter was delivering the food while holding a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
"The waitress came to us every few minutes and started clearing the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet pipe that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it)."
"I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would re-train the staff."
