Watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy the delicious Daddy Ganouts.
And there's the hook.
Raymond the bartender is stones!
The Pacific is a great place to relax.
"The drinks are great, especially when they're made by Raymond."
The omelette for lunch is wonderful...
"The snack is fresh, definitely not frozen..."
"Quakamole in the Pacific is delicious, like the wings of the Chimchiori."
One weakness is the chicken in the salads.
I also personally was not a fan of porcelain and asparagus.
"Generally, decent food at a good price, with friendly people."
The best Indian restaurant in town
"The decor needs to be upgraded, but the food is amazing!"
This little spot of Astoria Suvlaki makes what many consider the best round of New York.
"What really makes it shine is the food that is aggressively flavored with the spice of the cucumber, and it's all homemade (even the round sack and the sausages, and made from much higher quality ingredients that you might otherwise expect)."
"All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but Giro is the reason to come - if you don't eat one your trip was lost."
The best restaurant in Brooklyn
"Great food, incredible service, this place is a classroom."
The calf was incredible last night.
This place is a must visit!
Most of the conversations allow you to sit next to each other without looking like a couple.
"The food is all public, so we can order together and eat together."
My daughter's wedding reception at the water's edge received the highest praise from our guests.
Everyone loved the atmosphere (simple rooms and absolutely unparalleled views and wonderful food).
The service was wonderful .
Paul the Judge was a professional and he was always on top of things.
Thank you all at the water's edge.
"Service, but uninvited, dirty bathroom."
"The high prices you'll pay are for the view, not the food."
"The drinks at the bar were fine, to say the least."
The Tillapia thing was horrible... tasted like cardboard.
"We thought dessert would be better, wrong!"
"Speaking of bathroom, men's bathroom was disgusting."
The wine list was extensive - although the staff did not seem to know about the wine pairs.
"The bread they received was terrible - hard and cold - and the ""free"" olive affordable was disappointing."
"However, our main meal was wonderful."
"I had fish and my husband had a filet, and both exceeded our expectations."
"The dessert (we had a bean pie was good - but, again, my staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions."
"When we asked about ports, the waitress wrote down several but she didn't know prices or flavors."
It's not what I expected for the honor and prestige of this place.
"Overall, I'd be back, since it was a nice restaurant, but I hope the staff will pay attention to the details in the future."
- It's very beautiful.
Both are not as small as some of their reviews make them look perfect for two.
"The service was extremely quick and careful, thanks to the service button on your desk, but I just understood a word when the waiter took our order."
The food was fine and fair.
All the showroom shows go beyond the real meals.
"So what you're paying for is the restaurant, not the food."
High-quality food and services
The boodin is exactly the kind of service and food I enjoy.
"The servers are different, Greg is my favorite."
"Sometimes the tables don't understand his humor, but it's refreshing to have a server who has personality, professionalism and respect for the privacy of your dinner."
"It's the first place a runner remembers my order... I hope he likes his job, because I'm halfway brains to steal it for my restaurant."
Prices are fair at all levels for both food and drink
"I go out to eat and I like my classes, the waiters are patient and they never rush classes or force another drink."
Amazingly fresh dogs but the best of all are endless shrimps !
This place had all the jewels and I mean everything.
"It's incredible fun for hot dog lovers of all ages, do yourself a favor and see this place!!!!"
"Getting into Casa la femme last night was a real experience, unlike any other in New York!"
"Impressed by the decor, the food, the hospitality and the wonderful night I had!"
We're gonna have a great vodka with citrus and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that we're gonna die for!
"The food took a while to prepare, it's all worth the wait."
They pulled us into the belly dance show that impressed the crowd.
"I never write on these websites, but this restaurant is worth a mock!"
Dark on the food
"The menu looked great and the waiter was very good, but when the food came, it was average."
"Still, I finished my plate, and then I found a mushroom in mushroom sauce at the bottom."
"I showed it to the principal, and he smiled and apologized and brought us two free desserts (but he didn't ask us what we wanted, so he brought the last two desserts we would have asked for)."
"The manager finally said that he would make the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), making it look like a big concession."
"I've worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there's no way a worm can get into a well-cooked meal."
"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and usually so crowded, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service"
I 've had hair in my food twice since !
A big part of a big value.
"The food is delicious, rich and affordable."
The atmosphere is relaxed and relaxed.
It's a great place to order or sit.
My sushi experience with my fiancé was incredible.
Good creative roles
"Tomato is a great place to go if you don't like sushi, or if you have friends who don't like sushi very much."
They have great triple-color roles and Norwegian roles are awesome and full.
"A special role and a regular role is enough to fill you up, but save room for a dessert."
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert and a wonderful green tempura tea.
The affordable ones are delicious too!
Amazing food
Inland fertiliser
- I'm going to eat.
I've had my share of modern Japanese and this place delivers.
"The atmosphere was very nice but it was missing a little, trying to fix it with a crazy mirror design"
"Despite the confused mirrors, this is probably my favorite spot for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future."
Indian food is pretty good.
A very fancy place but not very good Chinese style Indian food
"Chicken is my favorite, most dishes (I must agree with an earlier critic) are quite fatty and very spicy, especially chicken chicken"
"My mom initially introduced me to this place, but even she (she's an Indian) feels that the food can be a little bit more spicy and a lot more fatty."
I was a little bit of a mess with the horrible food.
I went to a holiday dinner at the restaurant and the food was disappointing.
"Instead of making a vegetarian dish, the chef gave me a dish of frozen vegetables (minus sauce, nuts or whatever form or aesthetic presentation)."
This place only survives by fame.
"This is the most wonderful restaurant in all of New York, not just Brooklyn..."
"For seven years, they've been making the best, the best food and keeping it like this..."
"It never moves, it's never bad food, it's never bad service."
"Great food , great wine list , great service in a great neighborhood ."
The pizza of Patsy is true love.
Give me the best pizza on the planet.
That 's great hot dogs .
The hot dogs were warm and tender inside and had a lot of crunch and crunch from the outside.
Big reds are definitely a place to check out for late dinner or a lunch push!
"I think the dishes are a little greasy, but the food experience is good."
It's used and the average price for the dish is $10.
All you get is the decor (it's not very pleasant).
- I'm going to eat.
This place has great Indian Chinese food.
"Be ready to wait, because the place is too small."
"Although the place isn't pretty, the food speaks for itself."
"Best Chinese Indian in town, by far!"
"I ran into the underground village by accident, now I go there all the time."
Martini's amazing and very reasonable.
"The service is amazing, I had different waiters, and they were all good, which is rare in New York."
"DJ's great, I've been there for my birthday and many other times with friends and I keep coming back."
Everything on the menu is great.
This building is real.
"I wish we had more of these places: narrow, wonderful cuisine, top-notch everywhere, it was definitely worth the wait."
$500 for dinner for two without wine?
"Look, the affordability was really good."
The foot was also very good.
What you're paying for is the environment and the name.
"Yeah, the place is elegant and beautiful, but they're definitely targeting the Uber Whealthy not the Joe public who wants to go out every now and then."
"Vanison was good, but not great."
Bezon was very good.
Treasure clean destruction.
"I read reviews that said the restaurant was too expensive, and I thought, maybe it's worth it."
"The Four Seasons have a history and it's kind of a landmark in New York restaurants, but believe me, they'll charge you right out of your nose to say, ""I was at the Four Seasons Restaurant""."
"Overall, the food was great (except for desserts."
The environment is much higher and you'll see many rich guys with trophy wives or just high-paid escorts.
"If you go out to dinner, it won't be worth it."
"You'd think they'd make it up to you with a service, unfortunately, no."
"The service was fine, it's not what you'd expect for $500."
I agree that eating at Casa La Femme is like no other experience!
As soon as I returned home from my visit to Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit I felt compelled to try to warn other couchers who value their money and their time.
"We're late for our reservation, so I can't complain about waiting for a table."
It's a beautiful place.
The hostess was very pleasant.
Yet our $14 drinks were terrible!
We also asked for the hook six times and the waiter would tell us a minute and never come back with the hook.
After the fourth time I asked again and the waiter said after our dinner.
"We asked for sides, which the waiter admitted he forgot to put this part of our order."
"My chicken was disposable, as there were so many greasy blankets I had to spit on my rug all the time."
I didn't expect this for a $55 dinner.
"When we went out, our wallets were raw and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see after dinner, which would be acceptable if we could enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!"
"If I could do it there, I would have fought my bill, since my dinner was cancellable!"
"I've never left a restaurant feeling like I'm being abused, and I'm wasting my hard earned money."
The menu is simple without much description.
"There was no beer there, which was disappointing."
"It wasn't much to drink, but with Brahma."
The affordable things we ordered were served quickly - an order of roasted oysters and lizards was delicious but a small serving (maybe 3 of each).
"The lobster's nails were fine, but very imperfect."
I think there were two shrimp in the accessible salted shrimp sauce.
I had the Thai sea fried style that was very good.
Everyone seemed happy with their food except my brother who had the heart-shaped fight-fighting stuffed in grape juice!
I heard the lobster clock was great.
"All the food was fine - a little on the exact side, but fresh."
The service is not friendly at the big party!
It's a great Indian food.
"I love Indian and I eat it quite often, but I can say it's one of the best I've ever had."
"""Very normal Indian food, but very well cooked."
"I got it 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just the chicken tikka masala - without rice bread - is $25), which I would expect at a fancy Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have a fancy feel"
"Also, waiters try to pressure you to eat, like offer you things like they're free when they're actually $0."
"But if you're willing to spend a few bucks and remember to ask if anything they offer is free, then this is the place to go for Indian food."
"The bookie writes everything... ""Indian home rave""."
"The buffet for lunch is expensive, but it's worth it."
"We've only had dinner a few times, but they're all the same quality and service."
Bucharest is in my top five Indian places in New York.
I've never been so disappointed with food and service.
"However, as soon as I got my predictable intermediate order for what Dekeby thinks is Korean fair (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I spent about half my kimchee before finding a piece of random salad accompanied by a much more disgusting, tongue-in-cheek, clearly bad piece of fish skin."
"My main concern was the hygiene of the food they sent to me and to others, but I would be lying, and I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of 15, I expected at least a small effort from the restaurant to fix the situation."
"My girlfriend, who was a little more aggressive and was just as disgusted to have her throw away the rest of her minimum meal, called only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that she was probably a oyster and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant."
"It wasn't like he had any major points of pride before the hand, but now he's just careless."
A wonderful place for a romantic dinner.
I closed a beautiful white organ scene that contained a menu of four lessons that we really liked.
"The service was impressive, as the waiter knew all about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!"
I would recommend Casa la femme for any special occasion and to impress your date.
"The baby-beep was medium, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to the sitsoor."
Too bad I paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.
Nakgi-bokum was terrible.
It's the worst squid I've ever tasted.
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than Korean.
"The ice cream was on the table, and I got a filling on request."
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of services.
My wife had just touched that dish mess .
"The woman had the root, which was amazing."
Farro salad and Yukon pipe were also extremely tasty.
I love the pizza from Margaret.
We love this place every time we're in town.
An empty piece of pizza NYC
"The bark has a big bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity, the salt from the cheese is wonderful, it really enhances the taste of all the other ingredients."
"I personally like pizza margaritas better, but they're all good."
Maybe the most romantic restaurant in town.
"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasier (which does not serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!"
It's not just an adventure to get to this hidden place once you enter the unknown wooden doors... the genie and the familiarity will make you feel like you're no longer in town.
"If you plan on coming here, make sure your date is someone you really like, as they will take you to private cabins where there will be no people or food to watch (check those on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you can see the stars in the sky!)."
It's just you and your date and an occasional cute apology before the waiter opens the curtain on your campaign!
My party had the BB $29 Fix Price menu which was such a great deal after it came in with a sake plane!
We started with a wonderful mouth-watering amuse bouche.
"We chose the roasted black trout as my supply, which I completely ate while someone commented that the roasted salmon dish was better."
Sake has been very good to me and helps me get into Sake's world.
"For dessert, we tried the frozen black saussame mousse (interestante but not excellent) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake that were apparent."
"Maybe it was the big company (I had friends visiting from Philadelphia) yes, it wasn't a date this time) or the over-the-top price, but I can't say enough good things about this brazer."
"I don't usually visit the same institution more than once, or more than twice, but I'll come to Zenkisi anytime for a quiet, immediate and unforgettable dinner."
"Service leaves much to be desired, from feeling rushed to the place you ordered, to ignoring the rest of the night."
"They're extremely rude, they don't apologize for the terrible service they've given us and they bill us far more than $500 for some of their drinks and bread."
The great shabu shabu
"I tried a few other dishes, but I wasn't impressed."
But for Shabu Shabu you won't find much better in New York.
"The meat is fresh, the sauces are delicious, you get free kimchi and salad with your meal and the service is good too."
Dockby gives Williamsburg the right one-two punches of classic Korean food and a pig's belly-like fusion twist.
"The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason I'm here is the fantastic pork croquet sandwich perfect at the ski boun supermarket"
Restaurant with a view
The food was really good.
The family seafood was really good.
The original was also very good.
"The price is high, but the food is good, so I'd come back again."
This place doesn't make any sense.
This place has a very strange decoration stairs climb with mirror walls.
This place is not inviting and the food is completely strange.
The idea of Japanese tapas is new and obviously not working.
"The food they serve is not comforting, not irritating, not abundant."
Good food.
"The food was delicious and delicious, but the seating was too small, I don't like having cramps in the corner."
It was a very nice romantic place .
A colleague and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and I loved it.
The atmosphere was wonderful.
"The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say that margaritas were something to write home about."
"Our waitress was not mean, but she was not particularly warm or careful."
"I must say, I'm surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier this year."
"Still, we'll be back and I look forward to visiting in the summer to take advantage of the yard."
The waiters at the Flatbush seem to have perfected this awful technique to make you feel guilty and ashamed to accept their attention.
Another waiter added to the fun by throwing our feet in front of us at half our affordable (which was delicious).
"The food quality was generally quite good, although I've heard that salmon is much better when it's not cold in front of the visitor."
"The place has a nice setting some attractive furniture and, from what I could tell, a logical wine list (I wasn't given the menu when I asked for the carte des vins)"
How is this hair still open?
Everything was going well until we got our meals .
I looked at the chicken and I was terrified.
You serve it with leather on a bed of super-roasted spinach and chips.
"I got a bite from a $24 salmon and in the 17 years I've been in restaurants I've never eaten salmon as fishy, as dry, and as loose as that on the Flatbush farm."
"At this point, the waitress comes in and asks if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was phonetic and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress left."
"So I switched with my boyfriend to see if I could maybe rest it again, but the spinach was so hot I couldn't bite it."
"This is where it really gets really bad: the principal said, there's absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like, and I can't beg for it."
"The manager came to the table and said we could do whatever we wanted, so we paid for whatever we enjoyed, the drinks and the affordable stuff and we went out."
This staff must be fired.
"The first is the ""Scorpi"""
It was a really good pizza.
The crust was amazingly well cooked and the pizza was full:)
The worst restaurant in Manhattan.
"I'll be positive: the nice decor, the good hummus pie and the hat with the octopus was really delicious."
If I could give it zero stars I would do it for this place
"This place... oh, my God, where do I start?"
It's a pretty spectacular scene.
"But the decor seems to be the distraction, so you won't notice that you just paid $300 for some cold egg that took 2 fucking hours to come in!"
"How this place survives the competitive market of the western village in this economy, or any other, is beyond me."
That's great hot dogs.
"Although it's filled most of the times I've been here, spitting always delivers their food."
"The hot dogs are top quality, and the slam-wiches are amazing!"
Gorging is always worth the train ride and it will make your tongue and belly very happy!
The only complaint is the pricing - I think it would make more sense to pay a dollar less for every item on the menu
But still... a big place with a big meal.
Fantastic food - if the household staff doesn't upset you
"Every time we were there, the staff of the house (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet you and sit down) were so terrible to us that if it wasn't for the excellent fish dishes I would never have come back."
"BFC doesn't make reservations, so you almost always have to wait at the bar and be abused by the suburban staff until you sit down, which can be over an hour later!"
The fringe retro girl (with winged glasses) will call you if you try to order a drink.
I'd be scared if my staff rejected clients so early and so rude!
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" with brown hair, who listens to your conversation and knocks - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her unsolicited opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're saying."
"If you think you're gonna spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service."
- Eat and go.
"The food and the service were fine, but the boss was incredibly unfriendly and arrogant."
"As we finished our meal, which included a luxurious bottle of wine, our son-in-law joined us for a glass of wine and dessert."
"The guy refused to sit down and left, soon followed by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of traveling the world, including Paris, I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant."
"You can't eat here and disturb the bank nutritionist's mother's feelings, no matter how crazy she is, otherwise."
Best meal in a while!
The squid and the squid were great on Saturday night.
"I had the special lamb, which was perfect."
"My father had steak that was very good, and my mother had swordfish."
Four Seasons Restaurant is a great experience.
The food is great and the environment is even better.
We're taking the hot dogs to the next level.
"At first glance this place seems a little expensive for a hot dog, but with the crying you just don't get your average hot dog"
Here the super hot meat has been raised to the level of a real restaurant with many variations.
It's a nice atmosphere.
"I recommend the taco fish, everything else was fine."
The fire in her back is very hot but she needs a little more heat on a cold night.
Poor service and management
Don't go to this place.
I had a terrible experience at Casa la femme at a weekend dinner.
The manager was rude and handled the situation very badly.
I can't believe an expensive New York restaurant can be so disrespectful to its customers.
"The food is very good, but not excellent."
"It doesn't justify the reviews he gets, the staff stance or the waiting for a table."
"Mistakes happen, but they're usually accompanied by an apology, maybe a glass of wine... but not the cream we got from Al di La staff."
"The bread was outdated, the salad was overpriced and empty."
"The pasta was well cooked, it didn't have enough sauce and taste."
"The hostess was rude, and I had a clear feeling that they didn't want to serve us."
The only thing my friend forgot was that when he sat at the bar the bartender disappeared.
"I asked for a menu, and the same waitress looked at me like I was crazy."
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""I can help you"" and ""How many people are at your party?"""
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and lack of customer service.
Bad staff
I generally like this place.
The food is good.
The layout is good.
But the service is terrible!
"I was there for dinner recently, and we had a team of a waitress and a waitress"
The waiter brought us food with one hand holding what appeared to be a plastic garbage bag.
"The waitress came to check on us every few minutes and started cleaning the dishes while half of us were still eating (a big pet of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it)."
"I wish I liked this place better, and I'd like someone to train the staff."
